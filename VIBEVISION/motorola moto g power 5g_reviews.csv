499,1396,US,R3QX0PVMKSNRBB,THIS MOTO G POWER 5G IS AN EXCELENT PRONE AT A GREAT PRICE!!!,"I REALLY LOVE THIS MOTO G POWER 5G PHONE!!! I purchased my original Moto 5G in 2019 and for a very long time I was very hesitant in replacing it with a newer version. Even though I did consider briefly buying a Moto 7G Phone in 2022 but I just wasn’t impressed with the unusual changes Motorola made just to make it look and work “different”. However, when I first saw this 2023 Version I was very happy to see that a lot things were back to the way I remembered them before changes they made to the Interface were actually ones that I liked. Such as Swiping down on the Homescreen “twice” instead of “once” to Auto-Rotate the Screen, which I used to accidentally do all the time. I know that something like this is very minor but it’s just one of the many ways Moto rethought the Interface to be more user-friendly.
IMPORTANT POINTS:  This Phone has a Three-Day Battery Life, which is truly excellent! The feel, the weight and the look of it is really nice and it fits in my hand and pocket perfectly. The Display Screen and Refresh Rate is top notch and the Performance is Fantastic! Another BIG PLUS for me is that it has a 256GB of Storage as compared to 128GB. Also this Phone still has a Headphone Jack (Yay!) and it comes with a Phone Charger in the Box, which the 2024 Version does NOT have.
THE ONLY NEGATIVE: For some reason Motorola thought that I wanted to have Tik-Tok and another App already Installed and it was difficult to remove it. By the way, I heard that the Moto g Power 5G 2024 has A LOT more of these Applications ALREADY installed, which is absolutely something I do NOT want at all.
NOTE: I intentionally did NOT purchase the 2024 Version of the Moto g Power 5G partially because of the “reimagined” Interface, nor all of the massive amount of ALREADY installed “Bloatware” I’ve been reading about. Also, since I am very concerned about Security, I did NOT want the New NFC (Near Field Communications) which would include my Credit Card, Tap to Pay and other Financial information on my Cellphone. Although, I would have liked to have the New Wireless Charging Feature but it was something I able to live without.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QX0PVMKSNRBB,William Callaci,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on June 4, 2024",True,156 people found this helpful,B0BYGXFJ8K
499,1396,US,R28CBS2LO5QZMD,"Everything is Great, but please read if buying 2023 version","Everything works fine. Very solid phone. Supports 5g. What's to complain?? Well, for me it's the charge speed. In this day & age not having fast charging is a sin. I will be keeping the 2023 version as a backup phone or might just return it. Just ordered the 2024 version which supposedly supports fast charging & wireless charging. Been charging this phone since I got it & it's been about 3 hours or so. I went from 40% to 61%. Literally as I'm typing this. Just had to let people know since no one talked about it at all. If this isn't an issue for you, then this phone is your perfect phone. Otherwise I use my phone a lot so needing a full 5-6 hours to fully charge your phone daily is not ideal for me. Most reviews say Battery life seems to be quite good. Just the charge process seems bad. For me at least. I like to go out occasionally & knowing my phone will not easily charge fast should it hit zero doesn't put me at ease. For example like camping & using GPS or even using it to play music. In my experience phones will eventually die after a full day regardless of battery life. Meaning it will take at least 3-4 hours to hit 0% to 20%. Sorry, for the long scenario review. I just wished this product said it wasn't compatible with fast charging. Although to be fair it never said it did.

Hope this helps anyone to make a solid decision on buying the ""2023"" version of the Moto G Power. This is a solid phone, just a bit of a relic in charge technology.

**Update**

2023 version works solid. Only been 2 days but I've gotten the gist of it. It's definitely going to be my backup phone. No changes since my initial review. Battery life is standard. I don't play gaming apps much anymore so I can't say how gaming potential really is. Maybe someone else will do a stress test in regards to that. Still I'm a bit bummed about the no NFC & charging seems to have gotten better. A bit inconsistent with charge speed, but maybe it's just me or it doesn't like my lightning cables. otherwise very solid phone. Overall review 8.5/10. Perfect if you aren't too nit picky about tech & current accessibility.

2024 Version. Yeah, as I thought. Just using it I can feel it's more up to speed with modern times. Has NFC. Wireless Charge Capabilities. Camera is pretty good. Solid overall. With all the bells & whistles on battery life is good. I mean could optimize it to performance mode but what's the fun in that?? Otherwise this is a straight upgrade from the 2023 version. I wouldn't call it perfect, but I can say I can recommend it without hesitation. Definitely better than the LG G8 Thinq I had & I absolutely loved the LG G series. Oh & having the fingerprint scanner to the side where the power button is located is a nice feature. Although screen shots are a bit awkward if you try to use traditional inputs. This phone offers a shortcut. When placing 3 fingers (imagine a dog/cat paw formation) on the screen it will take a screenshot.  Although the emergency override with +Volume & Power button are both on one side so that's definitely annoying. Probably my only real con. 9.5/10, I would say it's a 10 but there are better phones out there. However for the Best bang for your buck. This is definitely a steal.

-5 stars for both versions now that I understand what I'm working with. Unfortunate that I was unsatisfied with the 2023 version, but like I said. Would make a great backup phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R28CBS2LO5QZMD,jeremy,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/3e8bf1a4-2ce4-4986-bd4d-1e1f27d8606c._CR1,0,497,497_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024",True,18 people found this helpful,B0BYGXFJ8K
499,1396,US,R258ZKJSGHOAWP,Still going strong.,"The information below still holds true.  However, after several weeks with this phone, I actually like it better than my Samsung A54.  When the screen is locked and off, you get these little information dots.  Based on the dot symbol, I can tell whether it is a text from someone, or just a notification from an app.
I can touch the little dot symbol, it will give me a little bit of information.  I can swipe from that dot, to dismiss, close out or respond.  I like that.  Lastly, I have noticed the battery life is better than the Samsung A54.  Not fantastic like my old Moto G Power, that would last three days easily, without needing a charge.  But, this one last about 20% longer than the Samsung A54.  Other than that, both phones (the Samsung A54 works just fine), are pretty good for the price.
-------------
This is an early review of the Moto G Power 5g-2023 model.  Just got it yesterday.

First, I have a Samsung A54, that I purchased least Christmas season and it works fine.  No broken screen, no scratches.  But the battery life on it (the A54) did not impress my at all.  Felt the same about the Nord 10, which also is in perfect working condition.

Realized that I had been spoiled.  By my 4 or 5 year old, Moto G Power 2019 or 2020 phone.  I could easily go three days, without having to worry about constantly looking at the battery state, with normal use.
Yes, it still works, too!  Oh yes, I wanted a headphone jack again, which the Samsung doesn't have.

Yes, I have blue tooth headphones (not earbuds), but a set of good corded earbuds, is easy to take out of your pocket and pop into your eye, when you are mobile.

So getting the new Moto G Power 5g 2023, at $200 was what I was waiting for.  Here's what I have noticed:
a. The screen is cleaner and brighter than my Samsung A54, at a lower setting.
b. It is actually a little taller and thinner than my Samsung A54, and not at wide.  So it is easier to hold in my hands.
c. Charging time is similar when I put them on two chargers of the same brand, type and wattage.
d. The front facing camera lens hole is definitely wider on the Moto G, I barely notice it on the Samsung.
e. Setup was very easy. I connected a USB-C, cord between the Samsung and Moto G, and all of my account information was transferred.  I could select NOT to transfer media from the old phone to the new one, since I had inserted, a micro sd slot into the new phone, with what media I always wanted to keep.
f. The fingerprint reader is on the side of the phone, vs, in the screen like the Samsung.  Which I actually prefer.

Here are the disappointments:
1. This phone is newer than the Samsung A54.  Yet, when I did the Geek bench Test series on it, the final results were that the Moto G Power 2023 is about 20% 'slower' than the Samsung.  Oh, according to Geek Bench, they have the same processor.

2. I'm only seeing a slightly better battery performance than the Samsung, which is very disappointing, because of the POWER name, that is slapped on it.  Definitely no where close to the battery longevity of my old Moto G Power 4g.

3. When I tested the wifi speed, the Samsung A54, downloaded faster, by about 20%.

4. This might be user error.  But I can't figure out how to get 5 app icons in a row, compared to my other phones.  The Samsung gives me a grid option, in home screen settings.  But I do not see that in the menu of the Moto G Power 2023, even though they 'both' have Android 13.

Yes, I know 5g drains the battery faster than 4g, when all things are the same.  I didn't expect it to quite match my old Moto G Power.  But I was extrapolating that it would be at least 30% better than the competing Samsung A54, which last about a day, before I have to recharge it.  It seems 10% at best of an improvement.

So if you have a Samsung A54, and you are looking for performance improvement, I would not buy this phone.

BUT, if you have an older phone, like the Samsung A52 (which I had traded in for the Samsung A54), this is definitely a good upgrade at this price, since it was originally about $299.  Especially, if you don't want to have to be bothered with wireless headphones, or fancy 'tiny' wireless earbuds, whose batteries, barely last a few hours.

Perception-Someone with 'wired' earbuds walking around in public, are because of industry image,  perceived as cheap.  That is the image that I want.

Will I return them?  Nope, too much hassle and they do give me the headphone jack, that I wanted.  But I know that POWER meaning of the past phones, is not the POWER meaning of the newer ones.

Attached photo, sorry about it being sideway.  The Nord plus phone is at the top (different wallpaper), the Samsung is in the middle and the Moto G Power at the bottom.  Same wallpaper because it copied over in the transfer.

499,1396,US,RVJB98QETL29T,Dad loves it,"I got it for my dad to replace his old phone. It's fast at doing everyday things like scrolling social media or articles.

Won't handle much gaming from bigger games. Pretty decent battery life. Camera is okay, not amazing but not terrible by any means.

Motorola is really cementing themselves as a mid-tier value smartphone, which is great since not everyone wants to spend $1000 every couple years.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVJB98QETL29T,Shelby,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0BYGXFJ8K
499,1396,US,R1EUBVDD58FXE8,"Great Phone For The Price, but..","I purchased this particular cell phone because the previous cell phone that I had was the original Moto G power 2020. I bought that phone shortly after it came out, and it was still working perfectly just last month as it was when I bought it close to 4 years ago.

Based on that alone, I decided to buy the newest Moto G power when I upgraded my Verizon plan one that included 5G service.

Most of the features are the same, but with newer and better hardware. The coolest feature of this new phone that I have noticed is the fingerprint sensor. While the 2020 version had a round fingerprint sensor on the center back of the phone, this cell phone has the fingerprint sensor on the power button. It's worthy to note that the power button is not round, but a small line shaped button on the side of the phone. Don't ask me how this can read a fingerprint, since only about a third of your finger touches it, but it works perfectly and I've had several other people try to unlock it using their fingerprint and it has always said that the fingerprint is not recognized, while it reads my fingerprint every single time without fail perfectly. This is very convenient and handy and I'm very impressed with this feature. The camera quality, especially the video quality, seems to be of top quality for a phone that only costed me $200. I only use the camera for enjoyment and memories, certainly not for anything professional, so somebody that is into photography May disagree with this, but I think the quality is great for the price.  The phone comes with Android 13 installed on it and with one promised upgrade in the future, but as of February 26, 2024, it is still operating Android 13.  Just like the 2020 version of the Moto G power, the battery on this phone is wonderful. I use my phone to browse the internet, get directions from Google Maps, and take a few pictures during the day, and while I work overnight for 8 hours, I turn on battery saving mode and am able to play music on YouTube during almost my entire shift, without charging my phone during that entire time. When I do charge my phone, it's usually in the range of 10 to 20% battery left, but it still fully charges in less than two hours, probably closer to 1.5 hours.

What I DON'T like about this phone is the audio quality. The quality of the audio on phone calls, Zoom meetings, etc. is perfectly fine and will get no complaints from me, but when I play music in my car via Bluetooth, I quickly noticed that the quality and volume are both not nearly as good as it was on my 2020 Moto G Power. The 2020 version used something called Smart Audio, while this 2023 version has something called Dolby Atmos. I've tried different settings in Atmos, different pre-set options like Music, Movie, etc. as well as just turning Dolby Atmos off altogether, and nothing has really made any difference. The quality of the music just isn't nearly as good as it was with the 2020 version of the phone. There's not nearly as much base, and when you turn on base boost, the base sounds even worse than with it off, which produces almost no base at all. Nothing is as clear or as crisp as it was with the 2020 Moto G Power, and since I drive and listen to music a lot, this is the main factor in me giving this phone a rating of 3 stars instead of 4. The 2020 version of the Moto G Power, I'd give a 5 if I could review it.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1EUBVDD58FXE8,Ryan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on February 26, 2024",True,106 people found this helpful,B0BYGXFJ8K
499,1396,US,R4O4A52XBPBO6,Hooked on Motorola,"I have to use my phone for work. I previously had a Motorola phone (bought 2019) that had 32 GB of storage. My employer has a suite of programs that were loaded onto the phone, and I was running short of space. So, I got another brand Android phone through work. However, it lacked key Motorola features to which I have become accustomed: no switching on or off the flashlight by making chopping motions with the phone, nor wobbling the phone to activate the camera.

My employer is a manufacturer, and we have to wear gloves in the plant. With the Motorola phones, I can get light without taking off my gloves. Ditto with activating and zooming the camera. So, I ditched the other brand camera and bought this one myself. I also had problems with the fingerprint reader on that phone (which used the touch screen).

I am happy with the purchase. I was a bit worried about the fingerprint reader, which I read had been switched from the back of the phone. However, having the fingerprint reader on the on–off button works well.

Another reviewer complained about the battery life, saying that it needed charging every day. I don't know what that reviewer used the phone for, but I typically get four days out of it before it has to be recharged. The battery consumption does go up a bit if I am somewhere where it cannot connect to Wi-Fi and it keeps hunting for a connection, so maybe three days battery life then.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R4O4A52XBPBO6,Chris,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on June 9, 2024",True,25 people found this helpful,B0BYL2G3SP
499,1396,US,R5I5489QXJ8R3,Long battery life.,"This is my 2nd Moto G Power. I like ti for the long battery life and good power management. Phones I've had in the past, I would charge drive to work,(90 min in california). Then plug it back in in the office. I would spend the day taking the phone with me and plug it back in when I returned to my desk. Then I would drive home and plug it back in there. I don't mention a phone because this was every phone I ever owned. I had a number vrom various manufacturers and models. Until I went with the moto g power. This phone actually lasts for more than a day and that's with me phoning and texting and surfing and streaming. You REALLY have to be doing A LOT of high use activities before you NEED to recharge in less than a day. That's a big thing for me because it keeps me untethered from the charging socket. This phone does all the usual smart phone stuff about like any other phone. It has a decent camera and decent sound quality. My only gripe is that when I switch headphones it cranks the volume up to the max. I have a couple of identical ear bud headphones. I had these same headphones on my old moto g power. On that one when the headphones ran out of juice I would to the identical charged other pair and just go on. Well, as I said, with the new phone when I switch it cranks up the volume to the max. I suspect that this may be an android as the old phone was 11 or 12 and the new phone is android 14. It's not a big deal but it's my one gripe. Unless you swap headphones like I do you probably won't even notice. I like this phone. I wish I could have found a black one but I had to settle for white. I was more interested in the best price rather than the color. Great phone, I like it enough that this is my second one. The review is asking about the fingerprint reader and face recognition. The phone has these features but I don't use them. I prefer to relay on a pin code for access. I have never had very good luck with finger and face on any phone so I don't use them.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5I5489QXJ8R3,Borgkube,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7f47fcea-ffbb-4218-a899-341d7bea7345._CR87,0,325,325_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024",True,16 people found this helpful,B0BYL2G3SP
499,1396,US,R3TL4D3ZG6GC6T,"Great phone, but going to return. (MOTO G POWER 5G 2023 - BRIGHT WHITE)","Had it for a couple days. Loved how long the battery lasted (12+ hrs). Didn't quite make it past the 1 day mark even though it says a 2 day battery, but no worries. I tend to charge my phone at the end of my day anyway.

I didn't like the ""bloat"". Lot of unecessary apps and folders and ""Hubs"". It was kind of overwhelming...felt worse than my samsung. I would get random ad like pop ups or pop ups of news stories I do not care for.

The phone is huge, I knew it would be big, but I wasn't quite expecting it to be so gigantic since I'm used to more compact phones (still holding onto my samsung s10e I was trying to replace) Great if you wanna watch videos on it, but unfortunately it was too much for my small hands to deal with. Additionally,  I know the phone would not at all fit in my pockets.

I do like that almost everything else was simple and pixel like. I originally was going to get a pixel, but given all the mixed reviews I've heard about them I decided to try Moto instead for a stock android experience.

It's also a very sleek and thin (to me) phone. Very pretty, and pretty snappy. There were a few hiccups here and there where it would take a a bit of a long time loading a page or opening an app, or even just starting up but that's okay.

I'm not a photo person, but the camera looks kind of poopy. Then again, it's a cheap phone not an expensive camera. If having a good camera is important to you, I would probably skip this phone.

For use of watching videos or listening to music, I say it's pretty solid. You could watch hours and hours of Netflix and hardly make a dent in the battery. The screen is great and the speakers are nice and clear as well.

The phone doesn't have NFC, I don't use that because I prefer to use physical cash and or cards, but I know it's a big deal to many who like the convenience of being able to leave their physical wallets at home.

The phone does have a 3.5mm jack and expandable storage which is great 👍

Overall, if the phone wasn't too big and bloated, I'd keep the phone. However, I would still recommend it as a nice budget phone under 200.

I can get at least two and have gotten as many as four days without a charge when used lightly. Used heavily for a full 12 hour day, I can still make it through the day without using power savers. The 2023 version seems to work just as well. The phone's size fits my medium sized hand well.

My 2023 phone updated to Android 14 as soon as I started using it. Transfer of data and apps from my old phone was very easy - Just use a USB C to USB C cable between the phones. Took about an hour.

499,1396,US,R2FASD6C13Y2J2,"Good, versatile phone","I purchased this phone back in March and had no trouble with it until a few days ago. I was using a language-learning app (Duolingo) and noticed the phone was getting really warm, then got a pop-up that my battery power was at 20%. I closed the program and powered off the phone. It never powered up again.

I tried volume-up + power (nothing) and let it sit for two days before charging again (nope). The phone is bricked. Not sure if those speed rounds in Duolingo are the culprit, though I seriously doubt it. I likely  ended up with either an overheated CPU or battery. Regardless, it's dead. I'm using a backup until my new one, same model as this, gets here on Wednesday.

I've NEVER had a problem like this with my other Moto phones, and I'm not ready to give up on the brand. Motos are great, responsive phones with practically no bloatware, and they're so customizable. They're also very reasonably priced, so I'm not panicking that I have to buy another so soon. But if anything like this happens again in just four months, I know there's a bigger problem.
