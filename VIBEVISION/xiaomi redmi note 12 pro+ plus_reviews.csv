164,485,US,R2A1C3F06R4W6N,Slow and laggy,"I bought this phone for gaming purposes and it does not run smoothly at all, it is laggy and glitchy. When I ran tiktok, it crashed. While playing mobile legends the controls were delayed and graphics had to be lowered. Although I lowered the graphics, the performance was still as bad. I do not recommend for those who are buying for gaming, look for better alternatives. As for everyday use, it’s okay.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2A1C3F06R4W6N,trinh pham,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on July 28, 2024",True,,B0BYLRB3RN
