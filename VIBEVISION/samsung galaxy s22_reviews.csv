713,2134,US,R3UAZ2B16EEV0W,Refurbished Samsung S22 is very nice upgrade,"Refurbished Samsung S22 is a very nice used phone only two years old and in very good condition. At less thank 1/2 the cost of the newest model, this phone makes a nice upgrade for an Note S9 that was showing its age. Battery life is still good and the phone works without any problems. Hard to believe it's used.

713,2134,US,RG5CUE5JSI96F,"Very Happy With This So Far: Great Phone for Great Price, But Some Key Downsides","I've been a huge fan of buying 1-to-2-generation old refurbished Samsung flagship phones. This is my second of them and I know some other people who have done it too and it's a great deal. This phone was top-of-the-line about two years ago. It is still a huge upgrade for me, replacing my 4-year-old Galaxy S10e that i obtained similarly back then. Very cheap, I was able to get this one for $235 which is a steal, this is much better than new phones in the same price range.

Things I like about this phone: it's relatively small, very fast, the display is super crisp. It's great at getting signal, and wireless networks and bluetooth pairing all work beautifully. I usually talk with a headset but phone calls without a headset are fine. The camera is great quality-wise.

Things I dislike about this phone: I would prefer it to be smaller. Phones keep getting bigger. The Galaxy S10e was slightly bigger than I like, and this one got a little bigger AND heavier. It feels bulky in my pocket. Also I don't like the location of the camera, because it tends to make the cases for this phone be very thin near the edge of the phone, which tends to make them break in that spot. And this is a design flaw with the phone, not the case, because the way the phone is made there is an area around the cameras that bumps out in such a way that makes it so you can't make that part of the case thicker. iPhones did a better job of this design, allowing for a slightly thicker piece of case.

And the other downside is the bloatware. Samsung is awful for the bloatware. there are some notifications that are very hard to turn off, like the one about ""Find Your Phone"". Samsung is constantly pressuring you to sign into their service, and it makes it very difficult to sign out. Two-factor authentication required to sign out? What a farce. This phone made me very frustrated at the people who designed it.

Lastly, the other things I really dislike about this phone, which unfortunately follows industry trends. There is no 3.5mm jack. I used that heavily and I really miss that. It's a big downside because now I can't use corded headsets, which I prefer in part because you don't have to change them. AND this does not have a removable battery.

The battery going is usually the reason I have to replace my phone, so lacking a replaceable battery limits the lifetime of the phone. Replacing the battery is affordable if I can do it myself, if I have to drive to a store and pay someone to open the phone up to replace the battery, it's not really worth it. So basically the lack of replaceable battery makes this phone shorter-lived for me...especially since the battery life is perhaps not quite as good as it could be. It's not terrible, but you really do need to turn power saving on from the start. I also recommend charging only to 80% to prolong the life, and then just charging more frequently. This device seems to run a little hot which tends to make batteries wear out fast, so definitely watch that.

With these limitations, I think this phone is still a great buy. But it does have some design flaws that unfortunately Samsung has not addressed in their newer phones. The whole industry has been moving in the wrong direction IMHO, planned obsolescence, making their devices non-repairable. I hate it. And because of it I refuse to buy new products. Buying old products like this is my way of protesting the industry. I refuse to pump big money into an industry that isn't representing my values and the things I care about in life.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG5CUE5JSI96F,Alexander C.

713,2134,US,R3VQBM5UQXMGJK,Very disappointed in sound!!,"I have now had the phone for about two and a half months. Getting worse all the time can't hear people, goes dead in certain areas, sometimes volume is loud sometimes it's so soft I can turn everything up all the way and still can't hear people.  Refurbished phones have no warranty so I guess I'm out of luck. I don't think it was ever refurbished in the first place I think they just resold it. Beware of this company!!!!!!!

Phone looks good, not a scratch on it.  Screen is hard to keep clean almost looks like it is not the original screen.  Can deal with that.  The main problem is the sound.  Very scratchy, cuts out during conversation, at times people can't hear me.  There are times sound is really loud and next it is so soft you can barely hear. Frustrating trying to carry on a conversation.
I would never buy from this company again, as it seems they did a poor job of refurbishing this phone.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3VQBM5UQXMGJK,Candy,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024",True,3 people found this helpful,B09V5LDZQ4

713,2134,US,R2WQ4GEIFPZOVA,Samsung Galaxy S22 Smartphone Review,"Overview
The Samsung Galaxy S22 is a flagship smartphone that represents the cutting edge of mobile technology. As a factory-unlocked device, it offers flexibility for use with various carriers. With a sleek design, impressive hardware, and advanced camera capabilities, the Galaxy S22 is designed to cater to both casual users and tech enthusiasts.

Design and Build Quality
The Galaxy S22 boasts a refined and modern design, with a premium glass and metal build. It feels solid in hand, with a sleek and elegant aesthetic that is characteristic of Samsung’s high-end devices. The device is available in various colors, catering to different style preferences.

Display
The phone features a 6.1-inch Dynamic AMOLED 2X display with a resolution of 2400 x 1080 pixels. The screen offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, making it perfect for media consumption and gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate provides smooth scrolling and a responsive touch experience.

Performance
Under the hood, the Galaxy S22 is powered by the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (or Exynos 2200, depending on the region), paired with 8GB of RAM. This combination ensures top-tier performance, allowing for seamless multitasking, smooth gaming, and efficient handling of demanding applications. The device runs on Samsung’s One UI, based on Android, offering a user-friendly interface with a plethora of customization options.

Camera
One of the standout features of the Galaxy S22 is its camera system. The phone is equipped with a triple-camera setup on the back, consisting of a 50MP main sensor, a 12MP ultra-wide sensor, and a 10MP telephoto sensor with 3x optical zoom. The camera performs exceptionally well in various lighting conditions, producing sharp and detailed photos.

The 8K video recording capability is a notable highlight, providing incredibly high-resolution videos that are future-proof and offer impressive clarity. The front-facing 10MP camera also delivers high-quality selfies and video calls.

Storage
With 128GB of internal storage, the Galaxy S22 offers ample space for apps, photos, videos, and other media. However, it lacks a microSD card slot, so users looking for additional storage will need to rely on cloud services or opt for a higher storage variant if available.

Battery Life
The Galaxy S22 is equipped with a 3700mAh battery, which provides decent battery life. It supports fast charging, wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging. With moderate use, the phone can easily last a full day, but heavy users might need to top up the battery by the evening.

Connectivity
As a factory unlocked device, the Galaxy S22 offers great flexibility for use with different carriers. It supports 5G connectivity, ensuring fast data speeds where available. Other connectivity features include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, NFC, and USB Type-C.

Additional Features

IP68 Rating: The device is water and dust resistant.
Stereo Speakers: The phone offers a great audio experience with its stereo speaker setup.
Conclusion
The Samsung Galaxy S22 is a powerful and versatile smartphone that excels in design, performance, and camera capabilities. Its 8K video recording, premium build quality, and vibrant display make it a standout device in the competitive smartphone market. While the absence of expandable storage might be a downside for some, the 128GB internal storage should suffice for most users. Overall, the Galaxy S22 is a solid choice for anyone looking for a high-end Android smartphone with cutting-edge features.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WQ4GEIFPZOVA,Michael Laguardia,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on June 19, 2024",True,27 people found this helpful,B09V5LDZQ4

713,2134,US,R35UT5SNFRM5P6,"No problems with the refurb. S22 camera great, battery and fingerprint sensor are disappointments","It's a real step up from my S9, especially the camera, especially 3x wide mode for close ups of small things.

But the battery time between recharges and also the fingerprint sensor is a major step down. Needs a charge in the afternoon if I've used it heavily that day. So I got a power pack and that helps, but it's a shame I needed to do that.

As for the fingerprint sensor, it just doesn't work half the time. S22 locks you out if you try repeatedly, and then you have to wait a while before it lets you try again.

It came in almost-like-new condition but not in original packaging, no clear plastic protecting the glass, and without the quick start guide, which is downloadable (and I didn't need it). What I needed was the Samsung Smart Switch app, which sync'd my S9 apps, though not my app data. For example my voice-recorder data is still stuck on the old phone, not sure how to get that moved.

Another minus was I couldn't get real accident insurance from Samsung or my carrier so I would have to go with 3rd party. Too much fine print for me to believe it's any good, so I'm `self-insured'. if I break the screen, it's never going to have any trade-in value and then I'll be looking for another refurb in the $400 price range. Better than paying like $200 for insurance and possibly deductibles for the next few years.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35UT5SNFRM5P6,Max Oldham,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2023",True,18 people found this helpful,B09VRVRBQT
713,2134,US,R2PX0MOW52A98S,Great condition but with a few flaws,"This is my third time getting a renewed/refurbished phone. The previous two times, the phones were indistinguishable from new. This phone looks and works great so far, but there are a few minor issues. First off, the fingerprint sensor will not work. It appears that there is a screen protector on, which might be why. Secondly, it was configured to be for Canada not the US. Thirdly, there's a scratch on one of the lenses. Fourthly, the battery seems a bit old- runs hot, doesn't last as long, and takes longer to charge. Overall I'm satisfied with the model, and the price, but a bit disappointed in these items.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2PX0MOW52A98S,AZ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 5, 2024",True,,B09V5LDZQ4
713,2134,US,R3P046FGZ7R27J,"Works well, battery so-so","I've had it a week now, and it works fine as far as I can tell. I am very pleased indeed with the camera. It came with many scratches, but only along the fine edges. The screen is clean. The battery isn't very good, but it according to videos I've seen the battery on these things isn't great. It also heats up quite a bit, and I think that's to be expected from the S22 as well. All in all I'll keep it because it works well and it was cheap.
