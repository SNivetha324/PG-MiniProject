20,50,US,R186ECHKXVWNGM,"Phone technically OK, but it won't connect domestically to US","I was on the phone with Samsung and my domestic cellular service provide (US) and neither could get the phone to connect to my cell network after 2+ hours. My suggestion: contact your cell phone service provider and ask for recommendations of what models to use and where to buy. It will save you a lot of pain. Under the listing ""about the phone"" it listed United Arab Emirates."" Not US. Also, Samsung said they have nothing to do with the Samsung Store on Amazon, and the a05s is a model they do not support. I don't know, I'm just the messenger. I thank my lucky stars for Amazon's liberal return policy.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R186ECHKXVWNGM,Robert Kral,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2024",True,,B0CSHH3YQ4
20,50,US,R20PZXEWOC0II4,Not for power users,"**edit the camera is an extremely weak point on this phone, but if you can live with that it's great

Great phone
Doesn't have NFC, so it's basic in a few ways. If you can live without it, it's amazing. Works flawlessly, great BT (unlike Motorola Thinkphone $400+) and battery lasts forever. I can go an entire day without charging. I use Trello, Slack, Figma, Zoom and all connected to NordVPN constantly have had zero issues. It's a workhorse and can keep up with everything I throw at it, and just keeps going. Best phone I've ever had and glad I got it.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R20PZXEWOC0II4,Mike Cooley,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7eb42e3f-9579-4992-b329-2d33906393a4._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on June 27, 2024",True,,B0CSHH3YQ4

20,50,US,R30S2ADGZ6FMFZ,Says it's unlocked but came locked to a region,"Bought this phone to surprise my younger sis for her bday. It seemed like a decent phone and not too expensive. Everything else on the phone worked as it should except for the service/data. When putting in a sim card it would not locate our carrier and not connect to data. It would show all the other info that is related to the sim card like the # on it. When trying to manually add a carrier no service provider would show, only thing it would show is raoming. We tried multiple sim cards too. At one point with a different sim card it showed something about at&t so we thought it could be locked into their network. I ended up doing some googling and came across a website called ""Direct Unlock"" and if you provide the imei number that belongs to the phone, you can pay to see if it's locked to a network. Paid $6 for that for it to tell us it's locked to a region, and that region was ""Open Mobile"" which is in Puerto Rico. We decided not to pay more money to see if it could get unlocked from that and just decided to return the phone and get a refund. Tried contacting the seller but they failed to respond. There seems to be other good reviews on here so it seems it's a hit or miss on if the phone you buy comes unlocked or not. It is a international made phone so its not made to work here but it sometimes care. I would say just beware if you decide to buy it. Overall I would say avoid buying this one unless you want to use it oversees.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30S2ADGZ6FMFZ,Abigail P.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/d55202e5-e315-40b6-a38e-a7c2e6700c7a._CR0,56.0,689,689_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on April 25, 2024",True,8 people found this helpful,B0CSHH3YQ4
