376,1021,US,R30VZSK5SXIH18,Best budget phone I’ve used so far.,"I lost my previous phone and decided to pick this phone up, and I must say it’s a great phone. The battery life amazing. It’s very sturdy with a case and feels well built. My previous phone would stutter sometimes while scrolling but with this phone it’s great. It’s smooth and snappy. It charges very fast as well. The extra volume boost is a nice feature as well (it’s LOUD). If you’re someone who just want to use the phone mostly for everyday things and want the phone to still have some premium feeling to it without breaking the bank, I highly recommend this phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R30VZSK5SXIH18,Adan Apolo,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 18, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,R27K6VD2K1A171,So far so good for the price,"I have this phone for a few months now and for the price, this is a great phone. I was looking for something that wasn't one of the mainstream brands like Samsung, Apple, etc. I like the features (decent storage, can use external storage, large screen, comes unlocked, good battery life with quick charging, various widgets, so many settings, and more) and the lack of ""bloatware"" that comes with the phone.

There are 2 things that I don't like about the phone compared to my last one (Google Pixel 3).

1, that I was aware of from other reviews, is the camera is not the best. Sometime you need some really good light for the picture to come out decent, otherwise pictures can be rather dark. I find myself editing them often to brighten them up. That and it lacks the crispness that you can get with phones like the Google Pixel and others. Besides that, it has some cool camera options, like professional mode (which if I learned how to use that I'm sure my images would come out a bit brighter), macro, others, and some of the editing tools are pretty cool.

And 2, something that bugs me enough to note it here, is the responsiveness of the screen. I don't think it is an app issue as it has happened with multiple apps, but sometimes while swiping in a direction, it doesn't always respond the way I want it to. For example, I use Spotify very frequently, and it's where I get annoyed at this issue the most. In Spotify, when you are viewing a song you can swipe from right to left to change a song, or swipe down to get out of the song view, taking you back to a menu screen. So many times, it does not register my swipe to the left, instead it registers it as a downswipe, exiting the screen I was on. And like I said, this happens with other apps too, where I'm trying to swipe across, but instead it registers as a downswipe exiting the screen I was on.

Other than the 2 issues I have with this phone, it's honestly great for the price. I'm disappointed with the camera sometimes, but that is coming from my previous phone's camera being so crisp and bright, and I also knew about it based on the other reviews I read. And the swiping issue can be annoying, but it is tolerable.

Overall decent phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R27K6VD2K1A171,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on July 26, 2024",True,26 people found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,R1G67DWTYOPHH,There is a lot to like here for the money.,"I'm conflicted even writing this but here goes.... This thing is impressive for the price paid.

I am a HUGE Samsung fan. I HATE Apple. I always spend the most money for the newest phone with as much memory as offered. My thought being it will last until the next time I need a phone. It will remain relevant, the tech won't be obsolete, and presumably I'm buying a quality product.

That mentality has served me well... Until it didn't. My S22 Ultra is having connectivity problems. We'll it really isn't that old and I owe $700+ on it still. So I was in a tough spot, fixing it means a bill probably North of $300(maybe more) and then I would still owe the money on top of it. I didn't thi k either option was right. Paying it off seemed too expensive. Fixing it seemed silly, and ultimately too expensive.

So in the short term I went and found the cheapest phone I could stomach. A Motorola something or other for $150. It had 4G of RAM which caused Microsoft Teams to not even start on my phone. It just instantly crashed. So for awhile I just used that as my Hotspot for my Samsung (which had its drawbacks for sure).

That isn't working. Alright I can still return this Motorola. What else for a little more money might be better? A refurb? Nope... Still $300+ in anything I would accept. I read. I researched. I finally come to the One Plus. Lots of nice things are said about the phone and fresh of my recent ""cheap phone"" experience, let's just say I was dubious.

It goes on sale for $230. Alright for $230 I'll bite.

I got to tell you... For a $230 it's hard to gripe. Is it perfect? NOPE. is it a flagship Samsung phone. NOPE. For $230,I give it some grace. RAM 8G which is so so, it supports virtual RAM up to 16G. Not as good as real RAM but MORE than serviceable. 128G of memory alright that's not great but guess what... It supports an SD card. Boom. Doesn't matter. The OS is largely free of anything I hate. It's functional. Some quirks here and there... But I adjusted pretty darn quick. The quick charge battery may be worth it alone. This thing just amazes me how quickly it charges. Is it good for the batteries longevity? I doubt it. However at $230, I don't really care. I am a POWER USER, a 5,000ma battery is good. Still not good enough for me. I figure I'd need a 10,000ma battery maybe a little more to meet my demands. The fast charge though, it gets lower than I like, blast it with the supercharger, 20 minutes later and I'm back in the game. The finger print scanner, I didn't think that it would be natural or useful where it is on the side. Not true. Dang thing works flawlessly always.

True downsides. The camera... It surely isn't a Samsung. Now, I'll give it props, in full light and still photos it's adequate. Not great, but it does the job. In the dark though... Oi oi oi.... Hot garbage. The screen gets bright, it really does, but it needs to be brighter, by... Shoot I don't know: 25-35%. It's manageable though. I honestly think those are my only gripes.

Its responsive and plenty fast at running the things I need it to do. I'm kind of shaken up about it because I'm not sure at this point I'll maintain my same theory about phone ownership. At $230 for.... 70% of the goodness let's say, I have a hard time thinking that $1400 for a new phone makes a lot of sense. Bravo One Plus. This is impressive.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1G67DWTYOPHH,Justin Time,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023",True,213 people found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,R3OLWVNWAXT5GP,Get this phone. It's a great value.,"Update:
I no longer close myself out of apps (except just now, bc this phone has a twisted sense of humor). Like any new setup, it just took a little getting used to. For example, I added a screen protector, not realizing it came with one already on it. I don't expect to upgrade for quite a while, but when I do, I probably won't even bother looking at other brands. OnePlus is the way to go - the Nord n30 feels and acts like a much more expensive device than it is.

Original:
I had never heard of the OnePlus brand until recently, but they seem to have a very good reputation. The Nord n30 kept topping the list of best lower-cost phones, so I took a chance and I'm so glad. My old phone was glitching a lot, basically acting like it was on the verge of total failure. I wanted to get something of reasonable quality, and fortunately, Amazon lets you pay in installments with no interest. That makes a big difference when money is tight, and at the holidays in particular.

It's thin and light, and the screen is about as big as it can get without being ridiculous. That's perfect if you're 40+ and don't see as well anymore. The downside is that if you happen to have small hands, it may take some getting used to - it's just the slightest bit of a reach. The display is bright and beautiful, and it's super quick with no lagging. If you watch videos or listen to music you'll notice that the sound quality is amazing, particularly with earphones.

I take a lot of photos, so the camera was important too. This one is very nice and I've gotten some excellent pics of the cat (and really, what else are cameras for?). I tested it on notoriously difficult holiday lights at night, and it did very well. Looking forward to landscapes and snow scenes. And more cat. The only thing that bugs me is I keep accidentally minimizing apps by swiping too close to the bottom where the functions are. That's something you have to acclimate to, but hopefully I'll get there soon.

Overall this is an excellent choice if you want a high quality phone that doesn't cost half a month's rent.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OLWVNWAXT5GP,Wayward Canadian,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/5e8cf485-740f-4a4b-978a-335646d4e91d._CR125,0,250,250_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on December 1, 2023",True,128 people found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,RGS79HRDLT4DP,An extremely solid budget phone with one notable issue (OS Upgrades),"Short version: I got this for my mom since she had a habit of buying the cheapest Samsung phones and then calling me repeatedly because they had weird issues. This fixed those issues.

This phone has a somewhat mediocre camera, a solid processor, plenty of RAM for regular usage, a good screen, lots of storage, and Oxygen OS is a very nice simple android experience for a very comparatively cheap price. the chassis feels kinda cheap but you should stick it in a case anyway so who cares.

The only real catch with this is that it only gets one major Android upgrade, period- vs I think the 3-4 upgrades the bigboy OnePlus models get. That's the only issue and it's a notable one depending on what kind of user you are so pay attention to it. The actual phone bits of the phone are all great.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RGS79HRDLT4DP,Fabricated,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2024",True,18 people found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,R3CLM71O2L9FRE,POWERHOUSE BUT...,"I've been following OnePlus 's products since the beginning, just never had an opportunity to get one. It's a fantastic, smooth, and FAST experience. It's a quick phone, yet great battery life. It has massive camera lenses that poke out a little, which I'm not very keen on but they look very cool. Fingerprint scanner is on the right side which is fine, but the scanner is very sensitive. It will often unlock itself by accident just because I simply slid the correct finger over the sensor not-knowingly; not a big deal but present. The display is amazing, clear, bright, and responsive. The UI is also very customizable, it's pretty cool, The phone comes with a pre installed screen protector too. Theres this cool feature the phone has where you can also designate up to 4gb of onboard flash memory to RAM so you effectively have 12gb of RAM which is gnarly, this is the only phone I've seen that can do that.

Update and revision: so my unit bent, and it did indeed have a case, a very sturdy one. The phone bent just above the finger-print reader and just before the volume rocker, and bowed it significantly. The screen didn't crack but it was visibly warped. It seems this unit may be fast but it can't handle the simplest of pressure, and I suspect there probably isn't any metal reinforcement on the chassis either; straight plastic and glass. The back panel is also prone to being scratched and scraped by literally anything that's semi hard. Sand, dust, just being slid across a table it seems. Not a big fan of paying almost 350 bucks for a phone that warps in under 8 months. I switched to a Razr flip because at least that's designed to bend.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CLM71O2L9FRE,Drew,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on February 28, 2024",True,20 people found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,R2MREW3R813AH2,Wow! I am impressed.,"I bought this phone at the recommendation of a friend who is very happy with theirs. I'm someone who isn't picky about my technology... I just want it to be straightforward, reliable and affordable. I'd honestly just get a flip phone if it wasn't so hard to get by in today's day & age without it being the expectation now that everyone has a smart device, on them at all times.

Well... this phone fits the bill and then some! First of all, the battery life is honestly baffling. I'm not joking, I drove 20 minutes with GMaps GPS running and arrived still at 100%. I was so confused, not a single percentage point? I just wanted something that didn't obnoxiously guzzle battery and got so much more! Not sure how long this level of performance will last with the limited knowledge I have on how to maintain it, but sufficed to say this is really amazing so far.

As far as everything else goes, I upgrade my phone so infrequently that I really don't know how it compares to what else is out there... even if you showed me ""the specs."" I'm sure it isn't the absolute best around, but what I can tell you is this: the call clarity is great, both handheld and speaker. Bluetooth connects quickly and stays connected. I can have a lot of apps and Internet tabs open and switch between them and not be waiting for stuff to load (don't worry, I clear them when I'm done). Oh and the camera quality is so clear! Long story short, everything that needs to work works, it works well, and it's pretty easy for a less tech savvy person like myself to figure out.

The price point is what initially sold me. I paid only $250 for this phone and I feel like it was an excellent value. Most other devices I've seen online average nearly twice that cost, or are a similar/lower price but poor quality. Not sure what you'd get out of the more expensive ones, but I'm more than happy with what I've got here.

TL;DR: if you ""just need a phone that works,"" get this one! You won't be disappointed.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2MREW3R813AH2,forest,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on May 19, 2024",True,68 people found this helpful,B0C22BRGLG
376,1021,US,R2SNE8MNKCOZXQ,nice and clear display...,"I like that this phone has a good battery life and charges superfast. The display is crisp and clear -- again something I like. The speakers allow me to listen to a lecture while driving if put on my shoulder. The one thing I dislike, and it is probably a part of the OS, is that I cannot delete portions of a message thread; the only option is to delete the entire thread. Also, I am used to a quick and easy way to add contact info to an incoming text. I go round and round trying to figure out how to do this with this OS. This is definitely an improvement to my Samsung and Motorola phones. No real bloatware. The automated ""clean app"" bing from T Mobile did not work despite multiple bings. That's OK just as long as I can do it manually. This is my second Nord OnePlus phone. It won't be my last. I already have the extension tablet with keyboard -- I like that I can ""cast"" my phone to that bigger work/viewing surface -- and I have the Pro2 earbuds. For a brand that I never heard of before seeing them on Mint Mobile, I am pleasantly surprised at the usability. and innovations. Their red cable recharger even speed recharges my Samsung work phone.

376,1021,US,RQN4QOWGZTCP2,"So far, I'm impressed","First off, I'm not a power user, so I can't speak to processor speed, ability to game, or any of that. 3/4 or more of the time I use it as strictly a phone, I don't even have data or WiFi turned on because I don't need it. This replaced a Moto Stylus that was losing battery capacity and was old enough to not warrant replacing the battery, which isn't easy anymore.
Battery life is better than the Stylus when it was new, and that's saying something.  If I'm just around the house, not using mobile data or WiFi, in a couple of days the battery may drop to 80% or so...which is pretty good because I'm in an area with lousy cell coverage, with the phone varying between towers in two different time zones. That's a battery eater, but this phone handles it well. It also seems to connect easier and with a better signal than the Stylus in the same areas. Granted the Stylus is 4g and this is 5g, but at my house there are no 5g signals, so everything here is 4g LTE.
Camera? Again I'm not a professional photographer, but the camera seems to be every bit as good as the one on the Stylus, which people rate highly. The pictures I've taken have come out well and I'm happy with the camera.
I rate the audio quality, of both the handset and external speaker on phone calls as better than the Stylus. The media audio has a 200% setting that is way overdrive in volume, I have some hearing loss and it's way too loud for me.
Changeover was easier than I've ever had. Most of my apps transferred with their settings and passwords, and yesterday when I went to set up Bluetooth for my cheap radio in my old truck, I was shocked to find that somehow it had set up itself.... I had phone functions and BT Audio (aka Sirius) without having to pair and enter numbers. The phone also pops up to tell me about apps running in the background that are wasting battery, and gives the option to optimize them for battery life which is great.
All told, I don't have many complaints. The method to power off is not instinctive, but it does prevent accidental turn offs.
All in all, if you're a normal person looking for a phone first and internet toy second, I think you'll be happy.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQN4QOWGZTCP2,Dennis C.
