140,249,US,R1MHJTWOUYQ6YE,Switched From Z Fold 6,"So about a month ago I decided it was time to finally break away from the apple eco system. I was sick of it. I really liked the refined design of the fold 6 and knew I wanted something that felt vastly different from a candy bar form factor.

The phone was great and had a lot of features that wowed me. The AI tools were fun and silly and the screens were bright and vibrant. I got blue bubbles working at home and thought I was good to go.

A week passed and I realized I wasn't in love. That damn front screen is just so narrow. I have little hands. I'm a small guy. I didn't think it would bother me. I couldn't type a sentence on it to save my life. The cases for it added such a strange cheap bulky feeling to the phone and made me feel like I was carrying around a TV remote. The inner screen was so damn glossy, I couldn't see outside or even in my apartment for that matter because it reflected EVERYTHING around me and was covered in smudges in an instant. You can't set the phone down flat on a table because of the camera placement. It was also uncomfortable to hold with those sharp corners.

The one plus open has fixed all of those issues for me. The inner screen feels so much more premium and the outer screen is a perfect size. I love the anti glare inside and can't get over how shallow the crease is. I honestly even like the OS more. Coming from iOS, it's a little more inviting. Of course I miss the wireless charging and AI features, but I can absolutely live without those. The cameras are so much better and I prefer the more tasteful image processing. Samsung pics look like an acid trip, they're so oversaturated. The OnePlus open feels so much more premium and carefully crafted. I also don't really need these phones to be much thinner...I like how solid the open feels. I don't feel like it's going to break every time I unfold it. While it may not be snapdragon 8 gen 3, gen 2 runs extremely well. Battery life is absolutely better even at high performance.

So happy to join the OnePlus ecosystem. Such a brilliantly balanced device.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1MHJTWOUYQ6YE,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024",True,40 people found this helpful,B0CHN7M531
140,249,US,RX12N5JQNLC6V,AWESOME Foldable phone!,"What can I say? The last foldable phone I had was the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2. I liked it a lot but eventually grew tired of the heaviness and ended up selling it. I also found the tall, slim, remote control profile of the outer screen to be uncomfortable to use at times, not to mention its unwieldy reachability. Unfortunately, Samsung has chosen to stick with the tall, skinny, barely useable design of the outer screen. OnePlus, on the other hand, provides a normal size outer screen, much better hinge with almost no detectable crease when open, a larger screen and many say an even better camera (albeit a much more obtrusive one) than even the new Samsung Fold 6! And even though it does not have the IP48 submersible rating Samsung has or the wireless charging, it does come with a proprietory 67 watt fast charger in the box that allows it to charge the phone from zero to 100% in under 45 minutes. Neither Samsung nor the new Pixel Pro 9 foldable can achieve anywhere near that level of fast charging. And the OPO beats both of those products in battery life by a mile! It's a matter of personal preference of course but, for me, the OPO is the far superior choice . You may feel otherwise. Oh yeah, forgot to mention it's just as light to hold and carry around as the new Samsung Fold 6 despite having a wider outer screen and a bigger inner screen. And with 512 GB it is hundreds of dollars cheaper than a comparable new Samsung or Pixel foldable, especially with the trade-in deal OnePlus is offering. You should also know unfortunately, OnePlus is only offering three years of software updates for this phone and four years security updates, while Samsung is promising 7 years. But honestly, there's no way I'm going to hang on to this phone for three more years. I'll likely trade it in when the OnePlus Open 2 makes its debut next year or the year after.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RX12N5JQNLC6V,TMac,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 3, 2024",True,7 people found this helpful,B0CHN7M531
140,249,US,R2WJIYAY9PPEG7,Solid phone and price is great for what you get.,"Oneplus open has stunning screens both outer and inner. Phone runs on Snap Dragon 8 gen 2 and is very fast, hard to tell which is faster SD 8 gen 2 or 3 it's that fast. I've had S24 Ultra and if it was fastern hard to tell. Charging speeds insane but I do still miss wireless charging because of the convenience after my reading every night  to just drop it on my wireless charging pad next to my bed at night, but have adjusted okay to just plugging in. But during the day after heavy use I just plug in and 10 to 15 minutes later I'm good for rest of day and then some. Love how the phone as a foldable is still pretty much same weight as my S24 Ultra was and I love build quality as well  Haven't really had and  noticably app issues so far but have only had the phone  a little over a month so time will tell. Nice that it comes with 512gb of storage that's going to be more than enough for me. I don't really care so much that the phones only rated for splashes as I never take it near water anyway. The other thing that's nice is how bright the screen gets out in bright sunlight. Very impressive. This phone no matter what I throw at it never gets hot. Only time I've ever felt it even slightly warm is when I charge it at times. All in all I'm totally happy with my OnePlus Open foldable phone. I'm new to foldable but with this experience I may never go back to regular bar phones we will have to see  I would recommended this phone to people that don't care about wireless charging and want a great multitasker and excellent media experience.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2WJIYAY9PPEG7,Tobey64,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 4, 2024",True,,B0CHN7M531
140,249,US,R1ESX6DEJXL9GK,Not very durable. Horrible product support and repair,"Decided to purchase the open plus open after seeing mostly positive reviews.  It worked great for 4 months, then the inside screen started to fail.  Random apps began to open and close.  About a week later a white line originating from the center to the edge of the screen ops up.  I sent it back to them for repair, on what was told would be 7 to 10 days.  I'm now on day 35 and can't get an answer on how much longer it will be.  I would not recommend this phone or company based on my experience",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ESX6DEJXL9GK,Michael Shane Pass,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2024",True,84 people found this helpful,B0CHN8FNW3

140,249,US,R2I6W77VL9834L,Meh...,"This review will mostly be for people with current flagships looking to get into the foldable market, Iphone user for 10 years recently swtiched from a iphone 14 pro max to the Galaxy 23 ultra earlier this year and couldnt have been happier, but ive always had an itch to try out a foldable, so when i seen one plus coming out with one that was more on the normal side of a cover screen and incredible specs i thought id try it out, first impressions, build quality is crazy nice, feels great, lightweight very snappy open and close, and having never used a foldable before, the inner screen is insane, you will never notice the crease and its so hard to feel so major props to one plus for that, mostly everything you see on the youtube reviews is true so ill skip most of that, but the question that stands is it worth swtiching from a flagship, and the answer is no. Cover screen which you'll probably be using at least 60% of the time is just way to small still compared to the s23 ultra or an iphone pro max, software just isnt there yet either very laggy compared to other flagships, lots of apps dont work on the cover screen, but surprisingly work on the inner screen? Also apps that have either face id unlock or biometrics on Samsung and Apple dont exist on the one plus which is VERY frustrating, having to type in a password for an app everytime is annoying it doesnt even let you save it on there regardless if its with biometrics or not, and this isnt all apps its just some, just like some apps not fitting the cover screen or inner, just a few i ran across in my case, while we're on that note though, i will say one plus has the quickest biometrics ever, truly incredible, lastly their software ""phone clone"" sucks its absolutely nothing compared to apples or Samsungs and when switching brands like that it makes it so much easier and more convincing to do so and it was just so annoying swtiching all my stuff and settings over manually, so in conclusion its a great phone, incredible build quality, beautiful screens, amazing cameras, speakers are the best out there, switching from another foldable, probably worth, going from a flagship, probably not. while its a great phone, you're still giving up quite a few things, id love for foldables to be on par with flagships but we're just not there yet.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2I6W77VL9834L,Kasey,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on November 30, 2023",True,93 people found this helpful,B0CHN7M531
140,249,US,R3GYWMTDUFHYBM,"Awesome phone, customer service not so much","So 1st off, this phone is awesome. Coming from a Zfold/flip 3-6 I'd say heads down OPO is one of the better folds I've gotten my hands on. Technically I stopped at zFold, wife has the fold/flip 6 and I opted not to swith back to Samsung.

Oneplus Open is my daily and I don't really need to go further on why this is one of the best foldables in 23/24. I've recommended and bought friends a few and I'm actually on my 2nd Open. 1st one drowned in 3 feet of water... Not the phones fault, was mine and fully understood I was not going to get it repaired/fixed.

ISSUES:
-Main issue with current phone is sometimes the UI gets stuck and when you press home you won't see your icons. You can always just switch apps or go back to your last one and then try Home again. Most times it'll show up. One time I didn't want to deal with it and just rebooted the system

-MAIN ISSUE WITH ONEPLUS is their Customer support.
1. Back to the wet phone. Again complely my fault and was prepared to buy a new one which I did before trying to see if it was fixable. I went to the website to try and see if they could service the unit and I wanted to evaluate if it was worth it to pay for a repair. Did a request online and I belive I sent it to customer service. One month later I get no correspondence from OP and so I ping them again raising a little bit of hell. I got an email finally saying I filled out the request but never sent it out to them.... Sure fine whatever.. In any case, I got the unit prepped and sent out to them and technically should have taken a few days after shipping for them to receive it and respond to me. No corrspndance for 15 days. They responded to my email asking if they received it and they sent back verbiage which said it might take 20 days to start repairs.  I don't mind this but would have be nice if I got an email saying they received the unit and that repairs may soon begin. About a week or so after this I receive an email saying the repair needs to be pushed up to a higher level... Which I assume was because the board was wet. And that was all the correspondance I got. Would be nice if they eventually told me it's repairable or no or if it'll cost me etc... No info... Now been 2+ weeks since and still reassuring email. I assume if they fix it they'll just mail it back, if they can't then they'll email me... Anywya got a spare phone so not in a rush for the old one. Just wish I knew what was happening with it.

2. Issue #2. Just realized that the Oneplus login I have on my Oneplus Open is a new account/different from my original/existing account. Granted it's the same email as what I use normally. My Oneplus 11 is working fine and has the proper data. My main concern here is the Red Club points, the items on my order history, etc. Also main reason I went in here was bc I may plan to Buy the Oneplus 13 which should release in a few weeks.
So pinged CS, got a response and general troubleshooting. I now have to delete the account I used in my OPO so I can try and link my original account to it.  Granted I purchased the unit from the US and I currently live overseas for work. Long story short, I still can't get my main account to be on the Oneplus Open. It's in my Oneplus 11 but they're not syncing. Issue now is I told rep thst I'm in a diff cou try and they told me to take a video and share... Sure... 1. Big file so had to share it out from a storage place, 2nd issue now is I get CS telling me thst the can read/view the video and thst I should try a other format. So my issue here is thst it's a direct screen recording from my Oneplus Open. I can view it on my OPO as well as OP11 as well as my Windows 11 Razer laptop... So i let them know this and ask what format they want me to change it to..... Funny thing is sure I can rip and change format but a simple windows and Oneplus open unit can read the file, why would I kow have to jump through hoops to try and find their spiceific format for them to view it... I wouldn't be surpsirsd is someone from thst end tells me to change it to IOS for at so they can view it.

Sorry for the long post but bottom line.. Great foldable if you want clean/no crease center and a usable UI but good luck if you have issues and you have to contact customer support. You'll jump through hoops on basic fixes and be baffled by some of the things they say. Been with OP since version 8 and have followed them since the released but I don't think I'll be going to the next phones unless I really have no choice.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3GYWMTDUFHYBM,Meinard Limpahan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/33bdb503-2554-493e-b5cd-71396c70e2f0._CR0,0,114,114_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0CHN8FNW3
140,249,US,R2XNYEGES520ZR,OnePlus Open vs Z Fold and Pixel Fold,"I have owned  the Samsung  Z Fold 3, 4, and 5. There were so few substantial changes in those releases that I sold the Z Fold 5 within three months of ownership. I never enjoyed using the outer screen for anything, especially if I needed to enter data, because it was too narrow. The cameras were too much of a downgrade from their S-series phones. Although they had pen support, carrying one required a thicker case on an already large and heavy phone. I wear pants with large pockets, but the long skinny foldable would occasionally fall out while sitting down.

While the Z Fold interface can be very good, there were too many duplicated apps that added little additional functionality, including their voice assistant. This unnecessarily increased overall complexity when using the phone.

I also purchased the S24 Ultra with AI built in, but only for the Samsung apps. Since I don't use their browser, voice assistant, messaging, or mail I didn't have access to much AI on that phone. Plus, I had become accustomed to the larger inside screen and missed that part of the foldable experience.

I then tried the Pixel Fold, but did not like its inability to easily lay flat, many apps did not display correctly on the large inside screen, it had heat issues when doing everyday things, and Google's pitiful history of pixel phone support (I have owned several early Pixel phones). I loved the outer screen aspect much better than the Z Fold.

I read several reviews for the OnePlus Open that were so good I purchased one and these are my notes so far.

Pros
- the outer screen is the perfect height and width for typing with my larger thumbs
- face unlock is more accurate and faster
- it is lighter than the Z Fold and much lighter than the Pixel Fold
- it charges in 42 minutes from 0%, so I do not miss or need wireless charging
- its larger battery lasts longer than the Z Fold 5
- while I am not a phone camera expert, my pictures are noticably better
- the interface is much simpler and streamlined with minimal app duplication
- I am surprised how much I like their Open Canvas multi-tasking implementation
- the crease on the phone is much closer to being invisible than all  Z Folds or the Pixel Fold

Cons
- not water or dust proof, just splash resistant
- not a wide selection of good cases",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2XNYEGES520ZR,Larry A,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on June 5, 2024",True,118 people found this helpful,B0CHN7M531
140,249,US,R16DD1SPQY1GHH,Nice debut,"Device is pretty interesting. Pros:
Form factor seems more ergonomic than Fold 5. Solid build. Battery life great, plus ultra fast charging option. Some things leave alternatives from Samsung in dust. Cameras better than Fold 5.
Cons: no basic native apps like mail, calendar, contacts, dialer, etc., so you have to buy 3rd party apps or use freebies most of which are pretty lame. Also no password manager, like they have on sams. Huge camera bulge module, looks cool, but always gets covered with fingerprints and not sure how durable this glass cover is, very large surface of contact in location prone to constant traction. Pseudo leather back looks and feels nice but also soft and prone to excessive scratches. Overall, great device, with room for improvements.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R16DD1SPQY1GHH,Din,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 16, 2024",True,,B0CHN7M531
140,249,US,R2ID6C3D2WY0R2,Upgrade from Samsung Z fold,"I've had a Z fold for years which I really did like but the battery life has always been sub par, something the Z fold is notorious for.  Being several years old and the battery life getting ever worse, I decided it was time for a new phone.  Doing some research, I found that the OnePlus Open has the best battery life for folding phones.  Researching the OnePlus Open extensively, it looked like it might be superior in every way.  For less money.  I decided to take a chance and ordered one.  I have had it for a week now and am very pleased with it.  It is, in fact, superior in every way to the Z Fold, which is a fine phone as well.  The battery life is, in fact, much better.  I also really appreciate the larger front screen.  Seems to be an upgrade in every other way as well.  When I took it to my local provider to activate and transfer all my data, the tech was very excited to see it.  He had read about it and was thinking of getting one but was hesitant to pull the trigger.  After seeing mine and playing with it a bit, he was sold and plans to order one.  He asked if he could show mine to his co-workers.  They were equally excited.
A little bit of research and the willingness to take a chance paid off for me.  This is a great phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ID6C3D2WY0R2,Bruce White,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 8, 2024",True,3 people found this helpful,B0CHN8FNW3
