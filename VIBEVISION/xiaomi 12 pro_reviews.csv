  I was purchased 03/02/2023 on Amazon online store MI Xiaomi 12 Pro | 5G (Noir Black, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage) | Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 | 50+50+50MP Flagship Cameras (OIS) | 10bit 2K+ Curved AMOLED Display | Sound by Harman Kardon | I bought a mobile phone B09XB8RRMV ( XI12PRO-BLK-12+256GB ) for Rupees ₹ 59,999.00 (Fifty Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Nine Hundred Nine ) on monthly instalments. From the 58th day of purchase of the mobile phone, various technical glitches occurred. In this regard, while using the mobile phone in their service centre, series of technical problems occurred. Due to continuous repair and their company was unable to fix it, they were given a replace mobile phone with a New IMEI number. However, for the past one year, there have been various series of technical glitches and problems while using their mobile phones. Xiaomi 12 Pro | Due to the series of technical glitches since they started using the 5G phone, when they approached their company employees to fix the glitch, they irresponsibly and indifferently. So in the past one year when I have been having various technical glitches and problems while using their mobile phone, I have no choice but to think that I have been cheated by your company and with great heartache. I didn't want to vent my frustration to the company staff by fighting. However last 09/09/24 Xiaomi 12 Pro | 5G suddenly appeared vertical lines. When I took it to their service centre to get it fixed, Xiaomi 12 Pro | The 5G display is currently out of stock and will be delayed, after a week they fixed the problem and sent it back. However on 19/09/24 Xiaomi 12 Pro | The 5G display turns black and becomes unusable. They gave it to their service centre to fix it and after 4 days they fixed the problem and returned it. Then on 27/09/24 Xiaomi 12 Pro | 5G suddenly has horizontal lines and creates an unusable environment. How can they deceive their customers with a mobile phone that is constantly experiencing technical problems? They had complained about this to their customer service centre staff on 27/09/24, but till date (16/10/24) no response or solution has been given. After 1 ½ years of buying the mobile, I have been to their service centre for product fault more than 5 times and it takes 5 to 7 days to get it back. Xiaomi 12 Pro | How can a mobile phone be used with confidence during travels and office work, when 5G is flashed and given to their service centre for troubleshooting and repeated use of the mobile phone causes various series of technical glitches and issues. So MI Xiaomi 12 Pro | 5G (Noir Black, 12GB RAM, 256GB Storage) | Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 | 50+50+50MP Flagship Cameras (OIS) | 10bit 2K+ Curved AMOLED Display | Sound by Harman Kardon | Mobile phone B09XB8RRMV (XI12PRO-BLK-12+256GB) to me at a cost of ₹ 59,999.00 (Fifty Nine Thousand Nine Hundred Nine Hundred) and an amount of ₹ 4,500.00 (Rupees Four Thousand Five Hundred) totalling ₹ 64,499.00 (Rupees Sixty Four Thousand Nine Hundred Nine). I humbly request you to provide refund my cash or ( ₹ 64,499.00 )Worth mobile for such amount.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RL4S0Q4FJ3783,VENKATESH ARUNACHALAM,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/f4d66ae1-fafd-40e2-a77e-0f5dedaeb910._CR0,0,396,396_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in India on October 16, 2024",True,,B09XB8RRMV

234,821,US,R1OP4W2ALWUMPP,"""Jack of all; Master of none"". Best suites for this smartphone.","A good phone with great display and it ends there. Quad Speakers (claimed) are tuned but Harman; but definitely lacks quality and also sound is also less. Wirless audio is good.
Pros: 1. Awesome LTPO AMOLED 2k Display
2. Good wirless audio on headphones and earphones.
3. Good build.
4. 5G Ready
5. Charger is awesome. I was able to fully charge in 25 mins.
6. Haptic feedback is above average, if not the best.
Cons:
1. Poor quality audio on quad speakers.
2. Mediocre camera set up. Both videography and photography is poor.
3. No Macro photography for this price is a blummer ( it is there on redmi note 10 and not on flagship).
4. 2x Telephoto lens is literally useless. Niether portrait photos nor zooming capacity is hardly usable.
5. Miui is buggy and bloated, even after paying 68k, you'll have some 3rd party keyboard installed, which we can not uninstalled.
6. So many bloatware, for a flagship - Mi should have cleaned it up a bit.
7. Worst memory management, memory leak and frequent apps crashing.
8. Bugs on video apps. Example YouTube - vidoes just zooms in so much so that video is not visible at all. ( Not video zoom feature on YouTube). Even after restarting app, persists.
9. Was unable to install Hotstar app from playstore. Had to finally install it from outside in the web which is not safe. ( No internet issues on wifi and 4g mobile data).
10. Unavailability of accessories like. Tampered glass is so irritating. I got scratches in very 1st week on screen.
11. Heats up very very badly. I'm not able to hold it for 2 mins. Hands are also heated up. Even simple task of messaging heats up heavily. It's definately a deal breaker.
12. Battery drains very fast. Although topping up battery is very quick, a good respectable SOT is necessary. But drains very fast. Not a full day phone at all.
If I get anymore experience, will update this. Thanks.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OP4W2ALWUMPP,Placeholder,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in India on October 27, 2022",True,10 people found this helpful,B09XB8RRMV
234,821,US,R35YHM1Z9IV54U,"Good phone, but with drawbacks","Pros - Good build quality. Good camera! Battery life is good if used for day to day activities. Good connectivity over wifi

Drawbacks - Most important - This does Not have a truly curved screen! The screen is flat, covered by a curved glass!!! One can compare the flow of text on phones like oppo find x2 and iqoo 9 Pro and you will notice that on these phones the text and pictures bend to the sides when you scroll horizontally. But in this phone you can clearly see that it's a flat scroll!!!

Connectivity over mobile network is not good in closed rooms. While the Asus rog 5 and the Oppo find x2 show upto 4 bands on the network indicator this phone goes down to 2! -95 to -100 for the Asus and the Oppo while it's -115 to -119 for the Xiaomi! That's poor!

Has a good display - but not anywhere near the Oppo find x2 which is way brighter! Difficult to believe that this phone has a peak brightness of 1500 nits!

Even though this is on Android 12 the miui software is not as good as color os. Recent apps can't be swiped up like in other phones, they need to be swiped to the side!

Accessibility features for apps like Nova launcher etc keep getting disabled even if battery optimisation is turned off! Features like double tap to lock screen don't work, which is very bad!!!

There is no option to pick colours from the wallpaper or to change the colour accent of the icons etc, which is disappointing!

Finally one important point - the first phone which i received was faulty. It failed to detect the sim and used to heat up and force the user to wipe the data, and if not used to keep rebooting! Amazon replaced the phone, and the second piece is working normally. If anyone faces the same issue please inform Amazon immediately.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R35YHM1Z9IV54U,Raja Iyer,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in India on May 10, 2022",True,6 people found this helpful,B09XB8RRMV
234,821,US,R1UAWFMI8BWXQW,Best phone for the price,"Bought this in Great Indian festival sale.
1.This is  lightning fast ⚡ mobile. Processing is very fast. You can click 30 photos in just 10secs. I have tried by keeping a timer beside.
2.Camera does good work. A bit disappointed with front camera. I was using redmi k20 since last 4 years which was having 16mp front camera but that was clicking much sharper pictures than this 32mp front camera.
3. I felt sound is a bit low. Sound could be louder. But harman kardon sound system does it's job, can be appreciated well with a headset.
Everything else  very good. No other issues",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1UAWFMI8BWXQW,J.Karthikeya,"https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in India on November 10, 2023",True,,B09XB8RRMV
