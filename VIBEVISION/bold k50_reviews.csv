24,38,US,R1ZQEUAIYZ6GDE,Best Phone Ever,"This phone is fast, reliable, sleek, simple, and honestly amazing. I have have iPhones, Samsung ZFlip s, Galaxies, all of the above and legit this phone is the best one I've used in a very long time. I'm also very critical when I review, so like, yeah, this phone is a beast. It's worth trying, the price is unbeatable and between the battery life lasting on a charge for like 2/3 days at a time, the touch screen ease, sound options and quality, and the storage being expensive via cloud while already being massive, this phone is the answer. For real, buy this one. It's 100% worth it. $1000 phone quality for $200. #GameChanger",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1ZQEUAIYZ6GDE,C-36,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0D897WH4K
24,38,US,R24WU60A5UXDZ7,Great Phone for the price,"This is my first blu phone and I'm very impressed to say the least. The screen is very good it's get plenty bright it's a curved display with 120hrz. Running day to day apps like Facebook, Instagram and tiktok runs with no problem. Text messaging, switching back and forth between apps is really smooth with the 120hrz display. It's running a near stock version of android 14. There's no skin like some Redmi phones.  You might experience a hiccup or two here and there but that's not a deal breaker at all. Very slim, lightweight phone that fits perfectly in my pocket with my other phone. The camera and speaker are probably the only downfall to this phone. The speaker isn't that loud and lacks base. The camera isn't to bad if you're in decent lighting and using the main 64 megapixel camera. not bad but I've definitely seen better.  I'm using this phone on mint mobile. I have no problems with getting notifications text messages and RCS chats work I get 5G connectivity with speeds over 50mb per second. Overall I really like the design of this phone the software. haptic feedback is very good when typing. The screen is probably the best that you can get in this price point. I would recommend if your looking for cheep android phone that can do it all",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R24WU60A5UXDZ7,Deshawn Williams,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/6820b9bb-8775-4bbf-8ebd-123b4252309b._CR137,0,225,225_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on October 7, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0D897WH4K

24,38,US,R3OTNLU084CZH2,Very adequate phone with good feel and great out of the box battery life,"Not my first BLU phone but my first Bold, not a bad option considering whats currently available.  My last phone was a BLU F91 5G, which if it was still available I would have just bought another.  I can't reconcile mentally why there is no wireless charging.  Seriously, all the reasonably priced options don't have it any longer.  The only reason I ""upgraded"" was because the battery in my old phone got hot enough to off gas and blow the back of the case off on my old phone so I did not have a ton of time to wait around looking for a new phone.

I have been using this phone for a week and here are all the things I have noticed so far.

1. It does have a dual sim card slot, but an odd one.  Its on the bottom of the phone, and very difficult to get out even with the tool they provided, it took a bit of a hook to get it out.  Its thicker than usual and the sim card kind of snaps in, because its double sided.  You put one card facing out on the top and bottom, new to me after having dozens of phones.  Nowhere could I find if it was dual sim in the documentation (Sim1 is on top).

2. Its big enough storage to justify not having an SD card slot.  I know nobody is doing it these days, but I have had more phones die than SD cards and a good waterproof SD card can save the day if you have a whole trips worth of pictures on the phone when you dunk it hard enough to kill the phone.  But, with 256GB its got enough storage for all my MP3's and lots of pictures (I travel a lot and am on the water often where I have no service but want to be able to have music on board) plus all my apps.  There was a bunch of unnecessary bloatware but not terrible and it was easy to clean up.  I am at 41% used before I start taking pictures so its a bit dicey for long term usage.

3. The onboard storage is slow.  Unbearably slow.  Transferring my files from my Windows or Unix PC was maddeningly slow, regardless of USB cable or which port I used.  These are the same devices and cables I use for my old phone as well as an even older BLU G91 Pro and they are both 100 times faster to copy files over USB either to the SD card or the internal storage.  It was so slow and unusable that I had to try multiple cables and ports before giving up on moving my MP3's over by USB and installing an FTP client on my phone.  That was the only way I could move anything more than a few small files on or off the phone.  Its something that I can overcome but its maddening.

4. It came with a screen protector on it.  Its good because there are not a lot of options yet, but I didn't see that anywhere.

5. The case it comes with is laughable and there are not many options currently and you never know if there ever will be.  Honestly for this to be in the Bold line and not have a better case than this is a bit odd.  My last 2 phones had the black lightly armored cases that were good enough not to need an upgrade, this one is going back a few years and its a throw away if you can find something better.  The first one I have tried doesn't even come close to having the right openings for this phone even if it fits the general form factor and camera lens so if you need a decent case maybe this is not the right phone for you.

6. The fingerprint scanner is adequate but not great.  Its in the screen which is the new hottness, but it doesn't work as well as my last several low end phones.  I have 7 or 8 fingerprints registered to try and help my two fingers work but I have to hold it just right to get it to unlock.  It works and I am getting used to it but the back panel and power button scanners both work better for me.

7. Battery life is fantastic and it charges well.  It does take a bit more power to do a fast charge but it is very fast and the battery easily lasts me all day.  No complaints at all, other than damn I wish it had wireless charging, I mean its 2024 and many, many cars have wireless charging and it would be great to be able to use it. I know it adds heat and I wouldn't really use it in the summer and its not that fast but if you are driving its nice to just keep it topped off if you don't want to deal with wires.

8. The screen is just lovely.  I really should have lead with this.  its the nicest looking screen I have every used, and its very bright and very clear.  It is so easy to read I might be in the market for a second one because my wife's phone screen is terrible compared to this one.

9. Its fast enough most of the time.  Fastest phone I have ever had, very responsive nearly all the time.  The ram is plenty for an old dude who has way to much open and way to many notifications all the time. The only thing slow so far is the camera, and I wonder if its because the storage is slow.  That sucks for me, I have missed several candid shots already and experience has told me this is as fast as the phone will get. I am going to have to slow down myself and see if lowering the resolution will help but as of now the shutter speed is slow enough I have taken several pictures of my feet.  I have only taken few a dozen pictures and a couple videos, and while they look really really good on the screen I haven't tried them on a big screen yet.  The camera would also benefit from some form of stabilization but it works well enough for the price point from a quality standpoint.

Overall its a good phone, I wish it had a decent case, and faster camera and storage.  It wouldn't hurt to have an SD card slot.  It still sucks to not have wireless charging.  I hope BLU brings that one back.  Its a great phone to look at and feels good in my hand and for the price its very good.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3OTNLU084CZH2,AMZSQ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024",True,32 people found this helpful,B0D897WH4K
24,38,US,R1OW2WFX11UBBY,Very nice phone but two problems,"This is a very nice phone in quality, screen Super AMOLED. Ram makes it snappy. Decent camera and decent audio. But the two issues for me that makes it not one to keep are heat, and no optical image stabilization. The phone gets a bit warmer than my other phone and that isn't good. The other issue is there is no OIS during video capture, and that is a big flaw for me. But for $199, I think it's a steal for a new 2024 BLU phone.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OW2WFX11UBBY,tien phan,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024",True,15 people found this helpful,B0D897WH4K
24,38,US,RD2KA2VV4EOUM,This thing is packed with More features than I thought,"I'm coming from a Blu G91 Pro which is a really good phone , but holy cow I wasn't expecting such a big leap in performance/ quality and how fast things could be . The face ID works almost too good because it's crazy fast and man the under the glass finger print sensor is equally impressive. This phone also has features my other phone just didn't have, like more camera features , more ram expansion and more things you can change or do. Also this phone is way brighter and with its 120Hz display which makes moving around very snappy. If your wondering about the display it's very crisp and I come from a phone that was 4g , but now with 5g I can run shows at a much higher resolution,  1080 no problem, even 4K no problem. Oh and if you like customization with your camera, well Blu has you covered, because all you gotta do is go into your camera pull down your settings and go into custom or you just have it where you can go with just more at the end with Pro features, Dual view video, macro ,group , slow motion, time lapse , AI and much more . Overall for $200 I can't imagine getting anything better , because you not only get a phone but a case , quick charge power brick and a cable . If that's not enough it has an edge display with edge lighting and a light on the back that can also do different things. Last thing , I guess someone was saying this doesn't have a RAW mode , it does just go into Pro Mode and pull down from the top where you'll find extra features.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RD2KA2VV4EOUM,kevin lawson,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a4a6be39-904a-4c5e-b60a-54bb19177efc._CR157,0,314,314_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 3, 2024",True,11 people found this helpful,B0D897WH4K

24,38,US,R41CL3LUTEVRV,A downgrade from Samsung Galaxy S21,"I wanted to love this phone for the price. I've had Blu phones as recently as 2020 and they did exactly what I needed them to do, and were always comparable to the Galaxy S series phones.

That being said, I was looking for a newer phone because my Galaxy S21 has a few weird glitches going on that annoy me (screen turning a green hue, a weird line across the screen) and the newest S24 is not currently in the budget.

Setting up the Bold K50 today was a bad experience from start to finish. The phone feels cheap right out of the box. It's not as wide as my S21 and probably weighs half as much.

The cable wouldn't ""stay connected"" to copy over my data -- despite the cable still being physically connected. So my call history and text history didn't come over.

No big deal, right? I can find an app to do that later.

Then, I was asked to download a bunch of fluffy games as part of the setup. Again, not a huge deal, I'll just say no to all of that.

THEN when I finally get into the phone, there are a bunch of apps I've never downloaded (PlutoTV, Texaco, Chevron, just to name a few) and I had to delete them all. Plus an additional page full of app ""games"" that I'd rather not just be right there on my phone without my permission.

After that, I couldn't seem to delete a folder on the home page, no matter how hard I tried. My only options were to view it bigger or smaller, but I couldn't actually remove or delete it, even when the folder was empty.

The final straw for me was the camera. It's probably okay quality but the camera takes incredibly small photos as compared to my S21. On the S21, the photo is the whole screen. Which admittedly probably isn't a normal photo shape (like not 4x6, for example) but it's what I'm used to and what I'm now looking for.

On top of that, the K50 doesn't have a zoom *out* feature which is one I actually use quite a lot.

Sure, some of this could have been things to expect or that I could have read about in the specs, and maybe that means I didn't look hard enough/shouldn't have purchased this phone. My success with Blu phones in the past led me to believe this one would hold up to AT LEAST a 3 year/version old Galaxy but the S21 blows it out of the water.

I started setup about an hour ago, and I've already switched back to my S21 and will be returning this phone. Hopefully the S24 goes on sale for Black Friday and I'll make a new purchase then.",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R41CL3LUTEVRV,Christina M.

24,38,US,R1USISXWO9WPF,BLU My Mind,"And to think I hesitated..I'm glad I pulled the trigger and made the purchase. BLU has stepped their game up and designed a very nice device with the K50. I've been using the Moto Stylus 2024 since launch and I put it down to try this jem out. Unboxing reveled the device, clear case, wired usb-c ear buds, charger & cable, sim tool, literature and a sticker. The phone in an easy on eyes (minding the Large camera bump) purple and feels good in hand. The Large curved screen has good reachability (for larger hands) with a preinstalled screen protector. The phone did get very warm during the Initial bootup and data transfer. No worries though as the process went quickly and flawlessly. I'm using T-Mobile and getting very strong 5G UC  connection with great up/down speeds. Call quality and earpiece are good although using the speakerphone isn't the best do to the lackluster single bottom firing speaker. Concerning the main speaker, it's sufficient for notifications and tones, but music and voice imo gets a thumbs down. There's no traditional headphone jack, instead it's incorporated into the charge port. I haven't tested the included Apple esq buds as I've paired my Galaxy buds2. Android auto works as expected and Bluetooth connectivity is fast using my UConnect system. Ive also paired up to my Wyze watch 47c with no issues. A few other notable likes are: Breathable light (rear notification reminder) Side swipe sidebar for apps (similar to Samsung)
Front and rear camera and video quality minus the zoom and video EIS. Fast In screen fingerprint reader
256 GB onboard storage despite the lack of SD support.
I uninstalled and disabled all of the bloatware and offers which there wasn't that many of. Battery life is exceptional under normal usage and I was able to get from 20 - 100% charge in 45min using the included brick. I'm not a mobile gamer but I did test Steam link and was able to play Starfield, Fallout 4 and Shadow of the Tomb Raider at 1080 with no issues including heating.
There is an initial general software for August 2024 security update, it's unclear to me how many software and or security updates will be released for this device. A few cons: The curved screen can allow for unwanted gestures, screen brightness in sunny conditions, no tap to wake screen, although has lift to wake. No SD card support, no stereo speakers and a bad quality primary speaker. Included case will yellow and is flimsy so an aftermarket case is advised.
Aside from a few beef's I can easily recommend this an everyday device.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1USISXWO9WPF,Voyager ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0D897WH4K
24,38,US,R2ITGZRXRDVJK0,This phone is great for $200.,"Received my phone from Amazon, a few days ago. The phone ran warm when first set up. However after I did the phone system update, the phone no longer runs warm. I also removed the clear screen protector; never cared for these on any phone that I've owned. The screen (display) is beautiful, bright, and crystal clear. And the speed and smoothness of any of the apps that I use, is fantastic. (I don't play games so I can't comment on that aspect of the phone.) Overall I'm very satisfied with my purcchase of this phone.
