210,470,US,RZWGRM0S2HIKK,"Awesome phone for the money, one of my favourite phones I had","My last OnePlus was a OnePlus 5 and I loved it. Then I switched to iPhone an SE and 12 Mini. I came back to android and got this one. This phone is super fast, the screen is very nice and the battery can last 2 days of light use. I do food delivery and can get a full day of hard use on it with a bit to spare. I carry my charger with me and it charges up to 100 in 30 minutes! I recommend this phone to anyone who loves android and clean software. I am a student on a budget and this phone surpassed my expectations. My only gripe is the software can (rarely) be a little buggy but that's few and far in between. I plan to have this phone for years. Works great with Visible by Verizon.

Pros:
•Great value for the price!
•Amazing battery life
•Extremely fast charging
•Accurate and fast fingerprint sensor
•Great speakers
•Amazing screen
•Great cameras (not as good as some other flagships, but definitely good)
•Fast (the Gen 2 Snapdragon is almost too overpowered and efficient, great for emulation like PS2, 3DS, Switch)
•Stays cool (has a dedicated cooling system)
•Clean software
•Fast Bluetooth connectivity
•NFC
•8GB RAM + more from system storage if needed
•Premium build quality
•2 year limited warranty with optional extended warranties

Cons:
•Only 3 years of android updates, 4 years of security updates (compared to Apple and Samsung, it's on the shorter side)
•Sometimes a lil buggy (not often, but worth mentioning)
•Face Unlock doesn't work well (I don't use it anyways)
•128GB storage gets taken up by system storage and ""other"" files",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RZWGRM0S2HIKK,Miguel ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 23, 2024",True,41 people found this helpful,B0CQ9SZ6CP
210,470,US,R11OI6XMELGI9O,Amazing Performance and Value – 5 Stars!,"The OnePlus 12R is an outstanding smartphone that delivers on all fronts. The performance is lightning-fast, thanks to the powerful processor, and the battery life easily lasts me through the day with heavy usage. The display is vibrant and crisp, perfect for watching videos or gaming. The camera setup is also impressive, capturing clear and detailed photos in any lighting condition. Plus, the sleek design and premium build quality make it feel like a top-tier device. All of this at such a competitive price point makes the OnePlus 12R a fantastic value. Highly recommended!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11OI6XMELGI9O,GuessMe,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 1, 2024",True,13 people found this helpful,B0CQ9WLBFF
210,470,US,R3PKRRQHXU2RPQ,Nearly Perfect,"Long-time Galaxy phone user. And they're great, but the OnePlus 12R is better in many ways, especially for the price.

The pros:
Fast and responsive
Super fast 80w charging
Great battery life
Gorgeous, bright display
Premium look and feel
Main camera does a great job
Fingerprint sensor and face recognition really fast and reliable
Offers ""edge screen"" function

Cons:
For some, the curved screen (though I happen to like it)

There's a Google page to the left of the home screen with no obvious way to disable it if you don't want it there.

One easy fix is to use a different launcher.

But if you don't want to do that you can go to:

Settings --> Apps --> App Mgm't --> select Google App - Disable it.

That gets rid of the Google page. Then you can go back and ""enable"" the Google app again.

If the Google page then comes back, as it did on my phone, repeat that process but then go back into Settings, go to ""Home Screen and Lock Screen"", then select "" Lock Home Screen layout"". That prevents any changes to the home screen and should get rid of the Google page for good.

But that's the only thing about this phone I've disliked. Otherwise, it's a dream, especially considering the price. If you're on the fence about it, just get it!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PKRRQHXU2RPQ,David H,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on July 7, 2024",True,57 people found this helpful,B0CQ9SZJN6
210,470,US,REDEJG6ZP8OOA,"Huge battery, fastest charging I've seen. Smooth software, great display, great speakers","Battery is enormous lasting almost a full day and a half of screen on time. Charging is crazy fast, 0-100 in under 30mins which is wild. Also doesn't get hot when ultra fast charging as I use Accubattery to check temps when charging. Software and day to day usage is smooth as can be with 120hz, little to no stuttering and lag noted. Display looks great. Camera is fine enough for me, I hardly ever take pics. For $400 dollars its arguably the best cost to performance I've had for a phone ever since I started using android around the oneplus 3t and LG V10 era. I use it 95% of the time for media consumption. Reading, watching videos, listening to music. Audio as well is exceptional due to Dolby speakers. They sound great. Love the phone. Only negative is that it 100% needs a case for comfortable hand usage, too slippery otherwise. Using on AT&T in Cali, good reception",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/REDEJG6ZP8OOA,Jay,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on July 30, 2024",True,19 people found this helpful,B0CQ9SZ6CP
210,470,US,R5KLBN11X6R6S,Great Phone - Amazing Battery,"My Galaxy S20FE is quite literally falling apart (rear of the phone came lose) so I needed to go with a new one.  After comparing specs and reviews for the Pixel 8 , 8a, 8pro, S23, and OnePlus 12r ..... decided to go with the OnePlus.  Am really glad I did.  Great phone, responsive, good sound, and an amazing battery.  Arrived with only 6% battery.  Plugged it in --- less than 15 minutes later it was already over 70%.  Have used it pretty much all day for various things and I'm still over 50%.  Plus, and I'm not sure how this happens but on the Galaxy, my best signal here has been 2 bars.  The OnePLus is showing four.

Assuming it continues functioning as it initially has ...... it's a home run in my book!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R5KLBN11X6R6S,Joseph G.

210,470,US,R1SWETG8JK583L,My Words Are Not Adequate Enough,"There is nothing I dislike about this phone. One of the things that blows my mind is how fast you can fully charge the battery, put the battery in smart charge mode, expand the RAM memory without the need to buy a RAM memory card, and the built-in speakers. Apparently somebody was thinking outside of the box when this phone was in development. They understood the critical importance of battery life and performance along with RAM memory. For instance I expanded my RAM memory from 16 gigabytes of RAM to 24 gigabytes of RAM by simply sliding the slider switch in the settings and what a huge difference it made. No freezing up of any apps, quick responses when launching an app or apps etc.

Although this phone does not have a memory card slot such as an SD card slot for external storage it more than makes up for that and you can get around that easily: You can share your files or photos very easily by 1. Transfer them using Bluetooth from or to your computer or another phone. 2. Tether to your computer or utilize NFC. This phone has two SIM card slots meaning if you want to add another number for business use you can do that without having to buy an extra phone - what a real convenience and money saver.

This phone is very intuitive and informative on many levels. The weight and feel is very nice and the appearance. There are a lot of hidden features and tricks within this phone. When the phone's battery is in smart charging mode and I highly recommend that the phone will record your charging habits thereby increasing the battery life based on your charging habits. In case you're wondering it only takes half an hour to fully charge the phone. I end by repeating my words are not adequate enough on how awesome this phone is for the price. Is it worth the price? ABSOLUTELY! Way to go Nord!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SWETG8JK583L,Norman A.

210,470,US,R1E18V6JV036II,"OnePlus... Great hardware, OS Needs Love","I really like these phones. This phone is beautiful. This is my second one. My first was a OnePlus One, and they have come a long way. You can't get hardware like this for a better price. I'm glad I came back.

Battery seems to go quick, but not as quick as it charges. The Camera works well enough for me. There's some very minor glitches with the OS, but nothing that really effects performance.

All in all I love this phone.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1E18V6JV036II,Van Schwank,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024",True,4 people found this helpful,B0CQ9WLBFF
210,470,US,R2DNOR2D5DS8TD,"Great phone, great bargain, meh camera.","The One Plus 12R has been a wonderful phone so far.  It's speed and streaming picture quality are top notch. The camera is just okay though. So if it's going to be your main photo shop, go for one of the phones with the Hasselblad (probably misspelled) cameras.  I have a dedicated camera, so to me it's no big deal.

210,470,US,RG2EG47MG35VS,Ridiculously good phone,"Ok so this might be a little long but the backstory of what led me to this phone is important. I had been an iPhone user for a decade and I recently upgraded to a 2024 Razr Plus because I was getting bored of iOS and wanted to see what Android was like. I had that phone for about a week and while it had a lot of cool features, a lot of things just didn't work properly. Also the cameras are pretty bad on that thing. Since I was in my 14 day window I was able to return it but since they already took my 14 Pro as a trade in, I needed a backup phone to use temporarily until the iPhone 16 Pro comes out mid-September.

I saw the OnePlus 12R and didn't really know much about it since America tends to only really talk about what Apple, Samsung, and Google put out. So I ordered the phone and when it got here a few days ago I headed into T-Mobile to return the Razr and activate the 12R. The employees were enamored by the 12R and raved about OnePlus as a brand and wished they still carried those phones.

It's now been 3 days since I've activated the 12R and I am completely in love with this phone. Everything just works properly. It's a night and day experience over the Razr which also costs over double what this phone is. This is no longer a temporary phone until the iPhone comes out. I'm not switching back. I'm ready to dive fully into the OnePlus ecosystem. I just can't believe a phone this cheap operates almost entirely at a flagship level.

When the OnePlus 13 comes out in December, I'll be getting it day one.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG2EG47MG35VS,Eric,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/1ccea365-8630-4579-b9a3-21daeb925e52._CR0,0,1122,1122_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024",True,6 people found this helpful,B0CQ9SZ6CP
210,470,US,RVUUY4TS5QDNA,Awesome Budget-Flagship,"I was forced to switch back to a Google Pixel 6a due to unfortunately losing my N200. Was waiting to see what deals would arise from the OnePlus options and keyed in on this phone at $400 (which then dropped to $350 on Prime Day) and wow is it awesome.

Definite flagship feel. Screen brightness and color are great, doesn't overheat like the Pixel, good connectivity on AT&T in a variety of areas (urban and wild, state-to-state) and is snappy regardless of multitasking. I love the OnePlus OS too—clean like Pixel but better gestures and sophisticated feel; major reason I came back. I'm an unusual modern phone user in that photo quality doesn't bother me but it is a few years lagging behind Samsung/Apple.

Big Plus!: it charges super fast with the included charger. I charge it only during the day for about an hour or so a day and it never dies! I was always the guy heh-heh-ing that I forgot to charge my phone at night so I was battery budgeting. Never again! I just plug it in for 10 minutes and get enough charge for most outings.

If you're not looking for a gaming phone, top-tier camera, or Apple then this is a best deal phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVUUY4TS5QDNA,Michele,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 2, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0CQ9SZ6CP
