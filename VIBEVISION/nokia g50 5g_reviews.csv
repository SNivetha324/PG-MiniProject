169,541,US,R22ZT34K07Q2OV,Absolute garbage,Fingerprint reader works but it also works no matter what finger you use in my experience I put in my thumb only and it unlocks with all my fingers. The battery life is not even close to what is advertised. The camera is terrible even compared to a Samsung or IPhone from multiple years ago my iPhone 5c I had a long time ago had better camera quality. The worst thing is my screen just decided to absolutely conk out and be unresponsive to touch and is entirely unusable like if you have a messed up video cable on an old vcr kind of look there was no accident to cause this either it was working and then just did that within a second I was using it when it happened. I tried to do a repair on it with phone repair tools as well and the outer glass they used is so thin and cheap is shattered when I was removing it to get to the actual screen I wasn't using a lot of force or an improper tool either. I've only had it for 6 months maybe too and for it to be complete destroyed when I've done nothing but take proper care of it is horrible I wish I could get a refund but I doubt I will. Also after about a month of use the OS will start to malfunction and give you error messages and massive freeze ups and loss of function without reseting the phone even then it sometimes persists. I would rather have a flip phone than this garbage I thought I'd branch out and try a different phone brand for once and this was a horrible mistake.,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22ZT34K07Q2OV,Matt,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on June 3, 2022",True,12 people found this helpful,B09GW969LH
169,541,US,R1S5NRMUO8L05W,You Wont be Disappointed,"So far I've been using the phone for about 2 weeks, and I think its a solid device. Apps and Games run pretty fast and smooth. The cameras are very good, specially the main camera. The phone supports fast charging(18watts) and also the updates so far have been on point. When I purchase the phone it came with android 11, but about 3 days after getting it, the phone received an android 12 update.  For those who want a top of the line phone like an iPhone or a Galaxy S level device, you might be disappointed with this phone, but for those who need a reliable device with a solid performance that wont break the bank, then this is the phone for you. The phone may not be perfect but the benefits outweigh what few setbacks it has.

Pros
Camera(great quality, and for those who are into photography full manual control(including Raw) are available.
Large display. The display is quite large which is a good thing for those who like watching content on their device.
Battery life last two days of normal use.
Frequent security updates for the next 3 years and two years of android updates.
Face detection is fast and so is the side fingerprint reader.
Large capacity 128Gb
The Back of the phone has a very fashionable design that stands out when light hits the back.
5G works great pretty much everywhere I go.
Stock android UI
Loud speaker
and for those who use it, it has a dedicated Google assistant button.

Cons
Screen is not 1080p, though It still produces bright and vivid colors.
Charger, The phone supports quick charge upto 18watts, but out of the box it comes with a 10watts charger. but Still charges the phone pretty fast.

Overall I think this is a fantastic unit, and for anyone who might be interested I say, give it a try.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1S5NRMUO8L05W,Francis,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on March 1, 2022",True,18 people found this helpful,B09GW969LH
169,541,US,R1OD00DZM24MMN,I love this phone.,"This is one of my favorite cell phones besides Samsung because I am a Samsung girl. I am a little bit concerned about this purchase this time only because when I received it in the mail it was supposed to be a brand-new phone (unopened box) but it looked like the box seal tape was sliced through with a razor or knife. I am going to purchase another one.  If the next one I purchase tape seal is sliced, then I am taking it up to amazon & physically asking for another one still boxed & seal still intact.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1OD00DZM24MMN,Niathenurse,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 24, 2024",True,,B09GW9KMHD
169,541,US,R3FXDQKEX96DTC,Too big for pockets,"The phone works fine and the battery life is great. I's just far too big. It doesn't fit in pants pockets well, so the side buttons get pressed as you sit and stand and have to adjust the phone through the pants. Since it's the volume button that is getting pressed, sound gets turned off so you miss phone calls and texts as there's no notification. I had to shut off the function of the left side button for the same reason.

Additionally, although the phone works fine on 4G LTE with AT&T, it does not have the oddball band that AT&T has for their ""real"" 5G, the n260 band.

I have always used Nokia phones (several decades) and liked them, but this one is not a win for me.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FXDQKEX96DTC,S.

169,541,US,R1C32OQEEOS3QY,Not up to par with other Nokia Phones,"This is the most annoying phone I have ever owned. I need to reboot it everyday, why it locks up. I am not sure if it the hardware of the awful Android 12 that was pushed on to it. Camera is great, everything works well except when it locks up or when I am in a hurry to do something it refuses to  respond. I have rebuilt the OS and did not solve the issue. I have used Nokia for the last dozen years in that time, one phone stopped working on calls, the others especially the Windows Phones were rock solid. I guess this is what you get when a Nokia phone is no longer manufactured by Nokia",2,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C32OQEEOS3QY,RC Roeder,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 19, 2022",True,4 people found this helpful,B09GW969LH

169,541,US,R3FDZSQQYGMKT2,Why isn't Nokia more popular?,"Apart from the pre-cracked screen cover, I really like this phone.  I don't know why Nokia isn't more popular as I find it easy to use and with a long-lasting battery.  I only needed to buy another Nokia because I accidentally dropped my previous phone into the dog's water bowl and didn't notice, and even then it kept working for quite some time before eventually becoming unreliable.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3FDZSQQYGMKT2,Critical viewer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024",True,,B09GW969LH
