81,247,US,R8UMWFE6Z8575,Great Phone - Great Seller,"I love this phone! When it arrived, I put my SIM card from my other phone into this one and I was making and receiving calls and texts within minutes. The data from my other phone - apps, contacts, saved files, etc. - transfered quickly and smoothly and I was up and running in no time. The processor is very fast, the cameras are crisp and calls are clear. The battery only lasts 2 days - not as long as some other phones - but I am never far from power. So, I don't mind. But the best part of this phone was the price. At under $100, it fit my very tight budget.

Not gonna lie, I bought this same phone from a different seller for about $40 less before I bought this phone. What a nightmare! I'll just say that the phone didn't work... AT ALL and I had to return it. Then, I bought this phone from this seller. The description for this phone was clear, complete, it answered all my questions and a few I didn't even know I needed to ask. Most importantly, it was honest. No information was omitted whether it was important or trivial and nothing was misrepresented. The phone I received is, and works, precisely as it was described - unlike the previous phone from the other seller.  This seller, unknowingly, turned a bad experience into a good one. For that, I am very grateful. The Moto One Ace may not be the phone for everyone, but this seller definitely is. You can trust that you will get the products they describe, just as they describe them. And that is worth more than any amount of money you might save elsewhere.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8UMWFE6Z8575,Krissy Cattrell,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/8df5825c-486b-40df-917e-705cc83b6b74._CR0,0,1155,1155_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on June 28, 2024",True,23 people found this helpful,B0C5BMB1WB

81,247,US,R1NHDNGRWJ1LSU,Great phone,"I have always liked Motorola phones and this is a good one. It's been well used, dropped, say on, gotten wet, and still functioning as designed. The glass is strong with no chips or cracks. Highly recommended if you're looking. Yes, I know 1 star, but I would likely give 1 star to any cell phone these days. A purchased product becomes property the buyer, and the buyer is in control? of it upon receiving it. However, cell phones are loaded with applications that are not needed for functionality, but a large number of the ones you don't want cannot be removed. I do not believe I am the only one that has issues with this extortion. As long as they force us to have apps, conveniences, assistants, etc etc that are NOT WANTED they will get 1 star.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1NHDNGRWJ1LSU,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 28, 2024",True,5 people found this helpful,B0C5BMB1WB

81,247,US,R2BD4V65LM12B1,"If in need of a simple, last-minute phone, this is it","This phone works fine. Is actually unlocked on all US carriers, and I was able to activate on Verizon easily. The only things that surprised me is that it's running Android 11 or higher, (I expected it to be running Android 10, as I have had a previous identical phone that had Android 10 pre-loaded onto it from only about a year earlier) and that it was a little buggy (the three bottom keys were unresponsive about 25% of the time, and restarting didn't help). It has a generally slower processor, so it won't outcompete much of the flagship phones of today, or its time, as it was released in 2021, but it is a solid phone with an outstanding battery life, which is the main reason that makes this a phone to buy. Is a great back-up phone or phone for a light user/older adult.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2BD4V65LM12B1,Merry Farmer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/bbf708c3-a095-4f52-b2bf-d9e330d2e796._CR0,0,440,440_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024",True,12 people found this helpful,B0C5BMB1WB
81,247,US,R1U5X8IZRBFUFE,The phone may be too smart for me.,"I love the memory capacity compared to my old phone. I've got lots more apps I can use. The trouble is that the thing is WAY too sensitive. If you touch it, it comes on to tell you the time. Can't figure out how to make it stop doing that. If I carry it in my pocket I'll wind up with 5-10 apps opened up when I thought it was on standby. I had to put in my fingerprint to start up and now if my wife wants to answer the phone she has to come borrow my finger to get into the thing. If I'm watching a video and the phone rings, I dare not miss the answer button or the phone goes away I don't know where. I admit it, I'm 70 years old and millenial Chinese phone designers have no idea what is an intuitive operating system for someone like me. I anticipate a long long learning curve.  Also, the charger/PC port uses an odd size plug rather than the standard C plug my old phones, my camera and other stuff use and I can't find an adapter from their so I have to carry around the cord if I don't want to risk the phone dying and leaving me stranded without even an Uber call I can make. Woe is me if I lose that cord. I'll probably have to buy a dozen of them cause sure as the sun rises, I'm going to lose several before it's all over. I'm going to have to go full Bluetooth for headphones because after a week the headphone jack won't let me fully plug the phone jack in. I'll have to live with it's quirks. I can't afford to wait for it to be repaired. I don't want to set up another one (I spent a week figuring the thing out), and I need my phone. There are some things I'm happy with. If I can just consistently answer a phone call without the thing losing the phone screen, I'll probably be okay. Very disappointed in Motorola and every time I hear the Asian woman say ""Hello Moto"" on startup, it make me a little crazy. It's like she's mocking me.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1U5X8IZRBFUFE,Tom King,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7caf0a61-d6af-4e21-8917-eacc083be944._CR0,0,397,397_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0C5BMB1WB
81,247,US,R2007GUAI3SSM7,This is only to answer the question it didn't let me finish.,"YES I JUST RAN THE IMEI COMPATIBILITY SEARCH FOR MINT MOBILE. IT WORKS.

And still have not activated this phone but it's not the fastest. I downloaded a bunch of crap just to see. At half capacity it is about 20% of the speed it was and I force stopped every app but left the cache files so ram is not adequate fkr anything other than gps contact phone call messages and quick search browser.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2007GUAI3SSM7,Vinstant Death,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/e304f38e-5c34-4d52-9afb-d969fe568b43._CR0,0,500,500_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024",True,4 people found this helpful,B0C5BMB1WB
81,247,US,RF8UOYDC5TFP6,My Mom Needed An Upgrade,"My mom had a smartphone that was older than dirt, as in something from the early 2000’s, and she desperately needed a phone upgrade. It was a bit of a learning curve for her (my mom isn’t super tech-savy), but once I activated the phone and she started it, she slowly got the hang of it.

I’d recommend this phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RF8UOYDC5TFP6,Tessali,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/7e725462-8d47-4aa7-82cd-572129c3892f._CR134,0,232,232_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on October 4, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0C5BMB1WB
