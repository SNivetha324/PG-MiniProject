355,1029,US,R1VJMUQEKA7TAY,"Jack of all Trades, Master of Gaming","Edit: wifi connection sucks. It would connect for a little bit, the won't receive signal. It will keep you connected to wifi, but will act as if you have no internet. I keep my wifi off for best data performance, which is great for me. For those looking to stay connected to wifi, this may be a deal breaker. I've looked on Reddit and this seems to be an issue with the 8 series. Hopefully it gets patched, but considering it's been over 6 months, it's unlikely.

I left Android for iPhone about 5 years ago, and I always missed the freedom Android gave me. The ""major"" updates Apple gave had been old features for Android. Recently, I fell in a rabbit hooe searching for Android gaming devices, and decided between this and the Samsung 23 Ultra.

I got the 23 Ultra, and instantly fell in love, but the Red Magic 8 Pro was my first pick, as a gaming (emulation) was my priority, so I returned the 23 and grabbed the Translucent 8 Pro. While the 23 Ultra is the better feature rich phone, the 8 Pro is a gaming beast.

First, I tested Genshin Impact, and while it performs better on iPhone 13 Pro Max (on Medium settings), this phone plays great with MAX setting when you set the in phone game mode settings to rise and the fan is blasting. To get great gameplay without compromising resolution and frame rate AND not having your phone turn into a piece of hot coal after 20 minutes is a absolut win for me. Mapping touch screen buttons to a controller definitely is a negative, as the performance is massively noticeable, compared to iOS native controller support, but that's a small price to pay for gaming freedom. I used the GameSir X2 (Bluetooth) for every phone.

As mentioned earlier, my main reason for switching is freedom, and part of that is emulation without hacking (jailbreaking) my phone. I downloaded everything from NES to GameCube, GameBoy to 3ds, and this is where the Red Magic 8 Pro 16gb version outclasses the 23 Ultra. Right of the bat, every game I tested looked and performed better.

With Mario 3D Land, the 23 Ultra played decently with 2x resolution  (""chugged"" here and there) while the Red had the same performance at 4x resolution on Rise mode. Dropped it to 3x and Balanced, and it played PERFECTLY. Visually, there is almost no difference in visuals between 3x and 4x on the phone, and was only able to tell them apart when I zoomed in on the screenshots I took to compare the different resolutions (from 2x to 4x).

I won't explain every test I did (which took about 3 hours), but the one that impressed me most was God of War Ghost of Sparta. I was able to play that with 10x resolution on the 8 Pro on Balance mode with as if it was running at 1x resolution, while it became almost unplayable around 6x on the 23 ultra. Those gaming features truly make a difference.

As for the other basic functions, some are serviceable, some are great. Calls on speaker are lower than when music plays. The music sounds great and loud to me (better than 13 Pro Max), but calls over the speaker sound like whisper in comparison. In a quiet room, any external noise would easily down out the call. Off of speaker, it sound loud and clear.

Music is awesome. Streaming through Amazon Music (cuz the stupid app won't let me download and listen on another app, nor transfer out), the phone is surprisingly loud and clear. I didn't notice any distortion or unbalancing issues with the bass, and I definitely enjoyed listening through this phone than I did on the iPhone and Samsung. The fact that it has a headphone jack may not matter if you have Bluetooth headphones, but now you can tell people to ""pass the aux cord"" XD.

The camera is surprisingly nice, considering it's primarily a gaming phone. The 13 Pro Max took some great pictures and videos, and the 23 Ultra blew that out of the water, but while the Red 8 Pro can't compete with them in a side by side comparison, they look great on their own. When you inevitably take a video or picture, you WILL be satisfied and impressed with how great they came out considering photography is not why you would consider this phone over something mainstream.

Last, and certainly not least; this charges FAST AS HELL! In about 5 minutes, you'll gain about 20%. In about 30 minutes, you'll go from 2% to 90%. It doesn't matter how fast this phone dies (this WILL last you all day with moderate use) if you can charge it to 100% in such a short time. Unfortunately, it doesn't have wireless charging, but with charging speeds (65w) like this, I wouldn't use it, anyway.

Tl;dr:

If you want the best gaming experience on your primary phone, get the 16gb Red Magic 8 Pro.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1VJMUQEKA7TAY,dragoonslayer12,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on May 16, 2023",True,122 people found this helpful,B0D8SW4GX7
355,1029,US,R1KBPXJE2TYQ65,Everything about it is amazing.,"2nd UPDATE on 8/7/2024:

Somebody asked if the Redmagic 9S Pro was compatible for Bend Oregon? To begin with, I have a 8S pro, the model before. I have not heard of ANY incompatibility issues. I have T-mobile and it works perfectly. It has a double sim tray and I could have 2 phone numbers on it if I wanted. I still don't game, but I use it extensively to watch videos and run my Powerpoint presentations (in Google Slides). Everything runs perfectly, and extremely fast, never a gliche. I know my phone is over-powered for what I do, but it's like owning a Lamborghini to run everyday errands. And the battery is the best thing. I still charge my phone every 3 days, and I use it a lot. I also use my standard 3.5mm phone jack a lot too and would have gotten it for that one thing. The antenna is great, never a gliche using google maps. It is just an awesome phone. I worried that it's 6.8"" size might be too big, but with a slim case, the thin phone fits easily in the front pockets of my jeans. I assume the 9S pro is the same or better.

UPDATE ON 3/24/2024:
This phone is amazing for what I need. Most amazing is the 6 amp hour battery that never seems to run out. I used to charge my old phone every day, sometimes twice a day. I charge the new redmagic phone every 3 days (still at 20%), and it only takes 18 minutes to fully charge! That one thing alone makes it worth the  money. It is extremely fast for video & powerpoint files, and the usb3.2 jack allows me to connect to my PC and easily and quickly move big files back and forth. You don't need to play games to make good use of an extremely powerful phone.

INITIAL REVIEW:
First I'm not a gamer, but I need a powerful phone with big screen, USB3.0 or better data transfer and most of all, a 3.5mm headphone jack! This has it all. It has an awesome big screen with graphics subprocessor system that makes it extremely fast, which wasn't absolutely necessary, but it plays my powerpoint files breathtakingly fast. The USB 3.2 connector connects easily to my PC because it is important for me to transfer large data files to and from the phone. It works great. It has 12GB ram and 256GB rom, the minimum for this phone. That is more than I need but you can upgrade to much more memory and storage. I use the 3.5mm headphone jack nearly every day to play music and videos, and absolutely would not have a phone without one. The BATTERY is a monster. It has two 3,000 mah batters totaling 6,000 mah. What that means is the way I use it, I only have to charge it every 3 days! And after I run it down below 20%, it recharges all the way to full in about 15 minutes. Amazing. I had heard that the camera wasn't the best, but it is plenty good for me. It has Sony lenses and takes great photos and videos, in high resolution if you want, and even has a pro mode for mini picture adjustments that I will never do. And it costs literally half what a flagship samsung or iphone cost, half. I cannot comment on games which this phone was designed for, because I don't play games. The simple cheap case I bought for it looks sleek and great. The only possible negative is that it's heavy, because of the huge battery that lasts forever. SUMMARIZING: this is one awesome phone that any older non-gamer will be thrilled to own. BTW, I am a simple consumer, I don't work in the tech field.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1KBPXJE2TYQ65,GBustin,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on January 23, 2024",True,46 people found this helpful,B0D8SW4GX7

355,1029,US,RXTOJTN5QIUVL,Very Nice Gaming Phone!!!,The product has a slick design and is easy to carry in your pocket. The cooling fan works wonders so your phone doesn't overheat.  The fast charger is very useful as you don't have to wait long to charge your phone.

355,1029,US,R1M2V3GDRWV7KS,Excellent phone once you turn off RTT calling,"It's an excellent phone.  Coming from iphone 12 pro max this phone is superior in every way.  I am on the t mobile network already so idk about the network compatability issues which others have spoken to.

I am going to explain how you turn off RTT calling though, which will make this phone incrementally better for  you and the people you call.

How to turn off RTT calling:
Go to Settings
Mobile Network
Change network type to ""3G""
Go into your dialer
Go into settings
Accessabilities
Turn off RTT
Return to phone settings
Mobile network
Turn 5g back on
Done

Pros: The screen is excellent, the CPU is excellent, the GPU is excellent, the refresh rate is excellent, the battery life is excellent, the charging speed is extremely fast, it's light weight, asthetically pleasing, the software is excellent and I have not seen any mandarin to English translation issues, customer service is prompt and thorough.

Cons: There is a serious lack of accessories in the market for this device, finding a high quality case (ie OtterBox, Pelican, Mouse, etc) is impossible, finding a real leather case is impossible, not many Android OS updates will be made available, phone and accessories are priced much lower on manufacturer website (ie ""on sale"" here is MSRP w/o markup), requires some tweaking (RTT off) to actually be a functional phone for any sort of business calls, game controller accessory doesn't seem to fully function with mobile games (PUBG only one joystick is responsive) however this could be due to the fact that idk how to set it up yet, customer service is very opaque regarding any sort of future updates or cut off for software or security updates and I find conflicting information online but again may be my own mistake.

Overall it's a very very high quality phone.  The performance is like nothing I have ever seen in a mobile device.  It technically has more ram at 22gb than my Acer Predator Helios 300 which has 16 gigs of ram and a 3070 Ti that Jarod labeled an ""S class"" laptop in 2022.  I feel like this is a much more appropriate phone to pair with that laptop, the iphone 12 always seemed like it was lacking by comparison.  If you have a gaming laptop I'd suggest this phone just for the fact that it will feel more like a seamless experience with the high refresh rate and benchmark scores when you switch from your laptop to your mobile device.  The issues with accessories are a big problem though, I would really like to have an ecco leather case or something more substantial like an OtterBox on a phone like this.  I found that the magsafe environment on the iphone was convenient, but I ultimately never used the wireless charging or the magsafe charger after the first year because they were so slow compared to the wired charger, and the redmagic wire charger blows that one away by comparison.  It's also worth noting that the heat difference between this and the iphone is unbelievable, that stupid iphone was always overheating, this redmagic phone doesn't even heat up while fast charging.  The integrated fan is a very welcome trade off instead of an IPXX rating as I rarely take my electronics into the pool and I do not make tik tok videos of my phone traveling through tunnels in canals.  It would be like if the predator laptop didn't have any fans and instead I could throw it into the pool and not have to use my brain for stupid things like consequences.  I guess a dust rating might be helpful though, especially since I can't take the phone apart like I can the laptop to CLEAN the fan so it's not a fair comparison.  I use all of these devices for work too and they are all perfectly suited to that environment.  The only thing lacking from a business / functionality standpoint is the lack of an integrated stylus, but idk where they would even put one in something which I imagine must be very compact internally.  However the ability to cast to my projector via the integrated widget is an excellent trade off and the ability to connect a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse as well as a monitor and Ethernet is just on a whole other level.  I haven't tried running MS suite on this yet but I'm not worried about it.  I don't see excel slowing this thing down with pivot tables, multiple tabs, or complex equations having to load.  I have not tried the mouse and keyboard yet but I am excited to in the future and with my projector as a screen.

For accessories I would suggest a carbon fiber case and glass screen protector (because I can't find anything else), with a ram mount phone holder since this does not support wireless charging.  Give the lack of a good case on the market and the delicate nature of such a powerful phone you don't want to skimp on the car mount and end up with a broken phone.  Otherwise it's a fantastic upgrade and I can't see any reason not to switch from anything else on the market.  For what it's worth t mobile has become a fantastic network after the purchase of Sprint, I have 5G almost everywhere I go and I do a lot of overlanding.",1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1M2V3GDRWV7KS,Hinkydoo,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 27, 2023",True,96 people found this helpful,B0D8SW4GX7
355,1029,US,R10IEDIQHXKEQ5,So close but the core reason you would buy a phone ain't here,"Feels great, personally I love hard corner phones. Looks amazing, really cool cyber aesthetic. For games and wifi, works like a charm, even coming with a game mode that you switch on (with a sick animation). The customization for the default phone is great, the ability to change charging sounds, the fingerprint scanner, the edge lighting all amazing features. The cooling system is amazing and it charges in no time. The battery lasts days on ambient or 24 hours if you use it for work. The pricing is great as well, I hate paying a whole rent check for a new phone.

So where does this beast fall off? Service. This thing gives you a very limited band of network service due to it being Chinese. so if you're not pretty close to a tower you will not get service. Which is the whole point of a phone. If you're going to release your phone ""world wide"" you should probably add more compatability for network providers. T-Mobile, att, and Verizon all have limited connectivity. It has some of the bands for all the providers, but not all the bands, which makes it limited in usage unless near a city.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R10IEDIQHXKEQ5,Krystian Perrin,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on July 21, 2024",True,4 people found this helpful,B0D8SW4GX7
355,1029,US,R1R1ABO3DJAQIG,Great gaming phone.,"9S Pro 12/256gb version here.
I was on a budget, so couldn't go for the higher end model.
The phone is nice and fast on response, but beware that it's a gaming phone so your milage may vary. Call can be a hit or miss(due to the other person not hearing me from the other side sometimes), receiving text is ok, and for everything else, it works just fine. Gaming with emulator and mobile games is really great. I use the fan on balance most of the times and heat was never much of an issue. I use it as a daily driver phone too, works as expected, sure not the best cameras and all, but hey I rarely take photos.

355,1029,US,R2JYGORGSDM0KU,Distinto,"Me llegó ayer día 1 de agosto, tenía un Samsung s20+ y fue un gran cambio para mí, lo primero que puse aprueba fue su carga rápida y me sorprendió en 20 minutos cargo un 50%, tiene buenos parlante y de buena potencia uno está colocado en la parte superior izquierda y el otro en la parte inferior derecha eso le da un sonido casi envolvente, mi mayor miedo por decir así era el calentamiento que tanto se mencionaban en las review pero eso solo pasa si juegas todo al máximo y me sorprende que no tenga una sola caída de FPS ,el cual me parece una exageracion por qué con que juegues con las gráficas recomendadas, que sería la alta el dispositivo va fresco.

Las camaras traseras no están nada mal puede que sea por la mejora de la IA, la que si va un poco floja es la camara frontal
Pero seamos sinceros este dispositivo no pensamos comprarlo para eso.

Tiene 2 ranuras para micro SIM.

Para los que no saben la batería de este dispositivo no se daña cuando se esta cargando y jugando a la vez  al activar la función carga separada ya que corta la carga y la suministra directa al consumo que estamos teniendo sin pasar por la batería 🔋🪫
Ya para terminar me gusto todo las opciones de configuración que tiene te puedes entretener un buen rato y dejarlo a tu gusto.

En resumen : Lo importante es ser feliz sin dejarnos guiar por la precion social. 🫡

Si algo llega a fallar actualizaré el comentario

Actualización= ya llevo casi el mes de uso y eh notado que tienen pequeñas fallas de compatibilidad con el sistema Game space Center que es el que se activa al entrar a un juego o activandolo al mover el botón rojo de un costado, aunque no es nada grave puede ser molesto que al poner 2 dedos en la pantalla haga como un contacto falso y se vea como si la pantalla temblará esto se arregla tocando cuál quier botón dentro de la configuración.

Consejo : hay juegos que tienen medidas de seguridad anti trampas estrictas un ejemplo sería (New state ) estos detecta Game space como aplicación maliciosa y no dejará abrir el juego, para corregir esto antes de entrar a jugar, entran al Game space y en agregar inabiliten el juego para que no se habrá con esa función, también desactiven la depuración por usb y el modo desarrollador.

Todo estás fallas son comunes en sistema recién salidos así que solo queda esperar que lo arreglen en futuras actualizaciones",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JYGORGSDM0KU,Jonaleo85,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a9c608ca-e267-4abb-ab62-6ae63116d4ac._CR0,0,388,388_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on August 2, 2024",True,9 people found this helpful,B0D8SWK722
355,1029,US,RM7BDL7I2XQBV,"Looks good, feels great, is great!","First of all, yes, this is a gaming phone, with that being said they design of the phone lets people know that; however, the most standout aspects of the gamer niche design does not scream when compared with other typical devices! The size of this phone is incredible and feels great in hands, big or small thanks to it's boxy body. While lacking wireless charging, it is arguable that the whopping 80 Watt charging (which the charger is included with purchase) makes up by getting from 0 - 100 % in roughly 30-40 minutes! On top of this the need to constantly charge is not necessary thanks to its 6,500 maH battery. The specs is astonishing when examining price aswell, it could easily be classified as midrange in price, but flagship in hardware! Great buy!
