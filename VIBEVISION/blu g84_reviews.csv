11,17,US,R1SQ6QJIZYYCVM,"Featured decision G 84_2024  6.8"" Android 14  4G , battery life","I compared to the Bold K50 Blu offers.  G84 was my decision, when I saw tempered glass protection for the Bold K50 camera lens, that did it for me. The G84 in my opinion is a solid choice for me. Size matters, when you have bad eye sight. The  Review for G84 phone is higher rated.  Both are Blu phones. The concern was foreseeable accidents with the K50 lens. I only buy BLU.  I never seen tempered glass cover for a lens. The screen quality, and fast charging, the ringtone sound quality are other reasons of choice.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1SQ6QJIZYYCVM,alfredocat,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/a90bb926-282c-40ee-8276-efa4abcb6e88._CR36,0,1369,1369_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on September 15, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0DD2L8STC

11,17,US,RHEBV6V7K1CJH,very nice but,"i bought a samsung tablet for portable illustration, but realized too late that it didnt come with flash for the camera. my current personal phones camera is smashed.
i basically bought this just to use as a camera.

the camera is very nice, autofocus works well, great dark visibility.
the Macro setting isnt very good, the normal camera takes a better focused closeup photo. you cannot force focus in the macro setting at all.

i also noticed there is no music player on the phone, ive noticed no modern phones ive bought have music players anymore, but my original 8 year old phone DID come with a music player.

i dont like the infinity dot front camera because it obscures full screen videos/photos, but you cant find any modern phone without it or with an unobscured framed screen anymore. again, my 8 year old phone DID have an unobscured screen (though its cracked now...).

decent for the price & im happy with the camera.
definitely comparable or better camera to an iphone or android.

Edit: well, twist of fate, this is now my main personal phone. My old j7 finally crapped out & turns out the tcl 10l I was saving to convert to my main- isn't actually fully compatible with metrobytmobile.
I tested this phone & I get 5g signal & perfect function.

A con I've found is that there isn't really much peripherals for this thing in the market. Like cases & screen protectors etc. I'd like to see some more options there.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RHEBV6V7K1CJH,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 18, 2024",True,5 people found this helpful,B0DD2L8STC

11,17,US,RG4GOAWTWR2X,A Powerhouse Of A Phone With Unbridled Freedom. Here Are My Notes…,"This item has been with me for a very short time.

I ordered the BLU G84 because it simply offers everything I could ever want in a smartphone, and more. With its impressive 3-day battery life, I can finally say goodbye to constantly hunting for outlets to recharge my phone throughout the day. The large 6.8"" FHD+ Infinity Dot Display promises vibrant colors and crystal-clear images, perfect for watching movies, playing games, or scrolling through social media. Plus, the 256GB storage capacity means I can store all my favorite apps, photos, and videos without worrying about running out of space. As an unlocked phone, I have the freedom to choose any carrier that suits my needs best without being tied down to a specific provider.

I hope you find this review helpful.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG4GOAWTWR2X,Rex Iriarte,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 20, 2024",False,4 people found this helpful,B0DD2L8STC
