352,890,US,R1DOGK10K92I4Q,Amazing Android 14 Budget Phone That Looks and Feels Upper Mid range!! Lilac Looks Great!!,"This is the best budget phone with Android 14 IMHO. I had the 2023 version and although this years Mediatek Dimensity 7020 is pretty much the same as last years Dimensity 930, the extra RAM (8 GB total) makes this device run smoother and faster. The screen is nice and bright. I love the battery life and the side fingerprint sensor and Face Unlock work a lot faster on the 2024 model. Thanks to Motorola for listening and adding NFC for easy Google pay. The Pale Lilac color is incredibly good looking and the vegan leather is so easy to hold and feels high end. I am also happy with the OIS camera, beyond solid. Glad I returned the Samsung Galaxy A15 5G for this. There were GPS and 5G signal issues and it was sooooo laggy while using my Amazon Flex Delivery App. This may be a mid-range phone but people think I paid double for it!!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1DOGK10K92I4Q,Mikeyt1818,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/df65ba94-c079-4dfe-89b7-29b874195ca3._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on June 12, 2024",True,89 people found this helpful,B0CVR23QCR
352,890,US,R15QU1IV137UUR,Moto G 5G 2023: love this phone!,"I've never spent $1000 on a phone and I never will, so I can't compare this phone to some of the higher end ones. But compared to past phones all $200 or less, this phone is AMAZING. My last phone was the Moto G Play 2021 which came with 3gb ram and 32gb memory and although it was a good phone, the memory filled up very quickly and I was always having to delete apps to use new ones, then delete them when I was done to get the original apps back. This problem went away after I finally realized I could install a micro sd card and have my whole spotify playlist downloaded onto it, but now that I have 128 gb of memory, that is something I will never have to worry about. Having an additional gb of ram has made it much faster than the previous phone, the picture quality is nice, everything works wonderfully. I imagine since technology is advancing so quickly, this phone is what people would pay $500+ a few years ago for, but now we can have it for the low price of $149.99.

If you decide to get it, make sure you get the correct case. There are many phone cases on Amazon where people are complaining that the case doesn't fit the phone and subsequently leaving a 1-star review, not realizing they got the wrong case. It's surprising how many people don't use their brains. If a case doesn't fit or the cutouts don't line up, which is more likely: that the case producer manufactured the product incorrectly, or that you ordered the wrong case?  In the Moto G Series, they have the Moto G Play, Moto G Pure, Moto G Stylus, Moto G Power and Moto G. So many Motos... Find out what phone you have and what year it is to make sure you are getting the correct case. I highly recommend the Anloes case for this phone, it is better and cheaper than the Otter case and has a dust cover for the charging port which the Otter case does not.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15QU1IV137UUR,Adam,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on April 6, 2024",True,40 people found this helpful,B0C2SWQBMB
352,890,US,RUTX80JYH9WAB,Great budget phone,"Slightly thicker than expected. Build quality feels a bit cheap and plasticky. Camera could perform better in low light and display could be a little brighter.
However, at this price point you're getting phenomenal value including a fast CPU, lots of ram and memory (expandable via micro SD card slot), incredible battery life, wireless charging, NFC, and a nice display. All in all, a rock solid budget offering from Motorola. Well done.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUTX80JYH9WAB,Yp,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/004e45ed-3160-4388-b92d-496498b8513b._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on October 11, 2024",True,5 people found this helpful,B0CT6BQV81
352,890,US,R29YLN54O3X4SS,Excellent Phone with Wonderful Motorola-added Features,"Purchased new during 2024 October Prime Days sale for $200.

Excellent phone with solid feel and function. It's a reasonably clean and normal Android experience, but the Moto Secure feature to auto-lock when it's disconnected from a previously-paired Bluetooth peripheral is a godsend. Ever since I read about someone whose life was turned inside out by a grab-and-dash robbery of his (unlocked) phone while he was using it, I've been quite worried about that scenario.

This phone natively includes that feature, which is great. I was trying to work with Tasker to implement it, but that was its own set of challenges (not germane to this review.)

All in all, a wonderful phone with surprisingly functional additions.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R29YLN54O3X4SS,tim dunn,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 10, 2024",True,8 people found this helpful,B0CVR23QCR
352,890,US,RQ93CEWEIXV4Z,Battery life is very subpar,"I got this phone to replace my old 4g TCL 30 phone, and I'm pretty meh about the whole affair.

The good:
It's a reasonably priced unlocked android phone, it works with Mint Mobile (and therefore would work with T-Mobile and Metro, ymmv) and is lightweight and slim. It receives and makes calls and takes pretty good pictures, though I'm not a big picture taking person, so others may have issues, don't know. The 5G service is quite nice and allows for a better connection when we are out in the country than my old TCL 30 4g. The screen is vivid and the look of video/pics/etc is pretty good.

The bad:
Everything is Google, there is no native barebones alternatives like my old TCL 30. It's annoying being asked to set up all the different google apps every time I need to open one... If I wanted to use all the features of each one, I would. Ex: I just want to see the pictures I've taken, I don't want to be reminded to set up the app to save my pics to the cloud every damned time I open it. I use it to take pics of electrical schematics so I can complete my work without returning to the stand book to verify different connections etc ... It's almost like Google saying ""are you suuuuuure you don't want to"" every time like I'm a child or something.... It's very annoying and slows me down.

The Ugly
Battery life is absolutely horrible. My old phone, with the same battery size, could stream Spotify to my earbuds through an entire shift and not be less than 60% battery, even after 2 years of doing this every Mon-Fri for 9-10 hours a day. The first day I used this Motorola the same way, my battery was down to 30% when I punched out to go home. That's absolutely pathetic. If it wasn't for the fact that this was a sub-$200 phone, I would have returned it and gotten another TCL phone. This is the main reason I gave this a 3 star rating. If you don't stream music all day like I do, or use it all day like a younger person then it would probably last longer. As with most things, your milage may vary....
Another serious negative is the button arrangement and shared capabilities, I'll explain.
The phone has the typical up/down volume button above the power button on the right side of the screen. The issue comes when the power button is also the fingerprint sensor. It's nice to just brush it to open the phone, but it's absolutely annoying when taking a screenshot or trying to restart the phone. It seems to just spaz out when hitting up volume + power button for a screenshot to restart, or any of the other button combos the phone is capable of.

Overall, for someone who doesn't stream music it's a decent unlocked phone, but for someone who actually does it's a no go because of battery life. That and the 'Bad' section above is why this is a 3 star phone at best. I honestly feel Im being generous giving it 3 stars as this is gonna be a $180 paperweight when unlocked TCL 50s hit Amazon....",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RQ93CEWEIXV4Z,Cheri Gavasto,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024",True,26 people found this helpful,B0CWHXVLXG
352,890,US,R11OZ51PSYO1Q5,Very impressive at a budget price,"I will not buy expensive phones nor subscribe to a carrier's payment plan to get a phone. Why should I when I can purchase phones like the Moto G 5g?
I recently upgraded an older Motorola phone. The battery was shot and as apps grew larger, I realized it's time
This phone was super easy to set up. Per the instructions, I just placed it next to my older phone. Bam! Everything was copied over. My wallpaper, photos and more.
The battery goes much longer and the phone, while some things are different and take time to adjust to, works really well for my needs.
I highly recommend it. Instead of buying into a warranty, I purchased a rugged case.
Amazon delivered both together in the same box.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R11OZ51PSYO1Q5,West Valley Family,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 1, 2024",True,26 people found this helpful,B0C2SWQBMB
352,890,US,R1XAHOI9XZACPV,"Surprisingly pleased. At first I thought this doesn't have thumb print, but does.","Solid phone, camera is decent. The only time I've noticed the 1600x720p screen having a issue is when I'm watching youtube videos. If you go on Netflix or another streaming app it look absolutely fine. I recently had a big issue with the company I was with changing prices. So I started doing some research, and started looking into unlocked phones. They seem to be somewhat older cellphones and pricier than usual. This Motorola is somewhat of a downgrade from the phone I had. Biggest difference being previous phone had a 1080p screen, gorilla glass, and crazy stupid fast charging. But, I couldn't change to a different cell company due to the android I had was not unlocked. That's what brought me here. I've had this phone for about a week, and I'm happy with it. I had a Motorola cell like 5-6 years ago, and one of my favorite features is the karate chop flashlight feature. Twist camera feature is handy too. It's nice to have that back again. I took some pictures of plants. The 48MP camera pics looked really good to me. I grew up on tube TV's, and VHS tapes, so the barley noticeable lower resolution screen doesn't bother me at all. If your a cell phone connoisseur this might not be the best phone for you. For the price though and the freedom to pretty much chose any company you want, I think this phone is a great deal. Oh, and the new cell phone company was able to activate this phone right away zero issues. I paid full price for a new one, but at the time I'm typing this there's a used one on here for $100. I wish I would've snatched that. Do your homework and check all the specs.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1XAHOI9XZACPV,Ortron,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 26, 2024",True,6 people found this helpful,B0C2SWQBMB
352,890,US,R2FE0JTHRMW66A,Real Phone and Not A Scam,"It's a real phone delivered to my door within 24 hours and not a scam. I popped in my SIM card and it worked. Pretty good deal for $150. As for the phone itself, compared to my 7 year old midrange phone that just went kaput on me, it's pretty decent. The only thing I don't like about it is it is an ad machine full of ads galore. Another thing I don't like is it comes loaded with bloatware and apps I will never ever use. It's going to take a couple of weeks (tinkering with it sporadically) to get it set up the way I want it. But like I said, $150 is good deal. My wireless provider charges nearly 4 times price for the same phone. Let's see if I can get 7 years of use out of this one.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2FE0JTHRMW66A,CustomerA7,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 16, 2024",True,7 people found this helpful,B0C2SWQBMB
352,890,US,RADHRVO8FGFVR,Battery life seems short.,"Old moto worked fine but only had 64 GB, and I was using most of it.  But it seemed at first, old moto battery lasted forever.

352,890,US,RUS5T1AR12AF2,Excellent 5G phone for the price,"I've only had the phone for a day, but so far I'm quite happy with it.  And it's a huge upgrade from my old Moto G5 Plus, whose battery was wearing out and which seemed to take forever to load web sites or even to display texts.  It's also huge in another respect -- about 3/4 inch longer than the old phone, whose size I really liked.  But I can still fit it in my pants pocket, and I'll trade the less-than-perfect size for the much improved battery life.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RUS5T1AR12AF2,J.
