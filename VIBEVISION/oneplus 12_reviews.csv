275,573,US,R3DZL0ZPWJIESL,It's hard to find something to complain about on this phone.,"Disclaimer: I use this phone mainly to talk, text and peruse social media.  I don't do too many live videos or take a ton of photos.

This phone does a great job in everything although it's really not a master in anything outside of battery life and charging options.  I get a full day out of this phone easily.  Usually around the 1 day, 3 to 5 hour mark before I charge each day.  I usually charge when the phone gets between 20-25%.  I can leave my house at 35% or even go to bed at 15% and never worry about running out of juice.  And even if I'm low on juice, I can charge this phone from 20-100% in about 25 minutes.  I am amazed at how I can put this phone on the charger and in just a matter of 5 minutes I've gained about 20% of power.  Even when using a USB charger, it's still pretty fast.  Wireless charging is about average.  That is the phone's biggest strength.

As far as talking goes, it has a good quality sound.  Coming from a Samsung 20 FE (Verizon service), I found myself missing a call now and then (goes straight to voicemail) or drops in audio when I took calls at home.  I've yet to have a problem with the OnePlus, so I'm guessing the internal anntenna is better because I'm still with Verizon.

There are a lot of audio playback options available (Dolby Atmos, Spatial, etc.) and I haven't tried them all out yet, but the speakerphone sounds loud and crisp.  However, when I connect to a Bluetooth speaker or in my car's audio system, the volume tends to be lower.  I have to really crank up the volume in my car or max out my Bluetooth speaker to hear clearly.  However, maybe there's an option I'm missing in the settings that would help me.

And there are a ton of options in the settings!  It can be overwhelming to someone who isn't tech-saavy, but it's not as bad as it looks.  Most of the settings are basic on the surface, but if you go into the sub-menus then it will get more advanced.  But you can control things to enhance the already superior battery life to changing your refresh rate for smoother scrolling.  Just about everything else is typical Android stuff, but OnePlus has some nice features of its own with the Floating Window and One-Hand Scrolling.

The phone needs a case.  It's not easy to this phone even with both hands.  I wouldn't advise anyone try it unless they have pretty big hands.  It will probably drop as you are texting.  But that's not a deal-breaker because cases are inexpensive.

The media on this phone is smooth.  It looks really good and there are options to tweak it even more.  Someone who is an avid TikTok or IG fan will be at home with this phone.  The camera takes amazing photos.  Unfortuantely, I haven't been on vacation yet to give it a real try, but what I've taken so far are very nice.  Definitely a little clearer and more realistic than my Samsung 20 FE.  Recording video is pretty impressive, too, but I've yet to do a live or video call.

Anyone who pays almost double for an iPhone or Samsung is really just seeking the brand.  Yes, those phones may have a few more bells and whistles with A.I. and they may have slightly (arguably) better cameras.  But if those phones are a 10 on a scale of 1-10 then the OnePlus is a 9.  And it is much, much more inexpensive to the point that you could probably get two of these for the price of an iPhone or Galaxy 24.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3DZL0ZPWJIESL,Quincy,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/e8299145-b68f-4195-a894-b0fa9d363b97._CR0,0,100,100_UX110_.png","Reviewed in the United States on April 30, 2024",True,80 people found this helpful,B0CQ5JGH2Y
275,573,US,RQHVM4L4SUEXB,Wow! This beast ROARS!!!!!,"This phone is amazing! It's fast, light, battery is in friggin real. The screen is bright and vivid, the sound is pretty good on the speakers. The range on the Bluetooth is the best I've found so far. I had my choice narrowed down to this or the Samsung S24 but at this price... No brainer.

275,573,US,R2JDA4PW1EIED3,Amazing Camera and great overall phone,"I've been waiting to get the 12 for a while now coming from a 9 PRO.  I went with this one for the new camera setup which I do NOT regret.  Great wide angle to zoom and macro.  Hi Res photos print well on 3x2 ft canvas.  The phone itself is speedy and battery actually lasts through the day. Screen resolution is fantastic even at reduced DPI which I use for battery conservation.  Wireless charging works flawlessly through a thick case, audio quality is perfectly clear both directions.  Hope I can keep it in good shape longer than I did my 9.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2JDA4PW1EIED3,Emmanuel,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 13, 2024",True,15 people found this helpful,B0CQ5MYYZL
275,573,US,R3RHWWV4NK58CK,"Great phone, affordable price.","I previously had a Samsung S21 Ultra, but was forced to purchase a new phone when the battery swelled so much the back of the phone popped loose and only the case held it together.  I did not have the best impression of the Samsung line, after that--the last really *good* Samsung phone I had was the Galaxy Note 2, many years ago. Since I refuse to use IPhones, finding the OS a giant pain to use and the app environment not intuitive at all, especially not for the kind of price they charge, I started to look at other brands.
So, I shopped around and finally stumbled upon several recommendations for the OnePlus 12.  Since the camera quality was important to me, and I also wanted something that looked attractive and felt comfortable to hold, I ended up choosing this one.  Migrating my data and installing the apps I wanted was very easy, and I have had no trouble at all since purchasing it.  It charges super fast on the included cable, lets me adjust all the settings I like to adjust, and does everything a smartphone should do.  And the camera is definitely better than the Samsung I had.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3RHWWV4NK58CK,Krista Wells,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0CQ5JGH2Y
275,573,US,R3LPYA5TMCM1PI,"Everything on this phone is Google, you're buying into all of Google.","I once had a OnePlus 8 I think... It came with its own apps. Phone, messages, calendar, email, etc... This phone comes with all Google Apps. Including the keyboard. Apparently OnePlus has given up on actually building solid apps and are just slapping Google apps into it. Had I known this I would have probably gotten a Google Pixel or Samsung phone.

The allure of OnePlus was that I was freeing myself from these corporate eco-systems that harvest my data and provide no privacy. Well not anymore. With the OnePlus 12 you get the Google Phone app, Google Messenger, Google Calendar, Gmail (so none of my private email accounts I use on my own domains can be added without routing all my email through Google servers to be scanned). At least OnePlus gave me a Notes app! You can disable these apps in the app manager but you can't uninstall them.

If I don't want my text messages scanned and synced with Google I could download a 3rd party texting app, same for all the other system apps. But there's two problems. First is that other apps are way less trustworthy, and secondly they often cost additional money to buy. And who knows when and how they might get ""updated"" over time.

What really drives me crazy is that this phone uses Gboard, Googles keyboard. I have no idea what Google is collecting from everything I type. I really wanted a free from big tech phone. I thought OnePlus was different. This is a sad day.

Other than this being a Google-everything phone, it's pretty good. The hardware is solid but the software could use some polishing. The camera is good but the built in editing software is horrendous. The camera doesn't shoot using the full amount of megapixels unless you switch it to a special mode, and then it can only shoot in RAW or JPEG... Not HEIF for some reason. Weird. Since HEIF supports 10bit and 4:2:2 color and smaller file sizes. Nope. If you want to use the full 50MP it's either massive RAW file or JPEG.

The screen edges are curved. Makes it feel like a phone from 10 years ago. But the screen is bright and beautiful.

By default the screen resolution is lowered, I left it that way because I can't see the difference. The power mode is lowered, again, left it that way because its so fast and snappy I can't imagine wanting more. The battery life is AMAZING... At the lowered resolution and power mode.

I use Nova Launcher because I cannot stand the Google Discovery thing being baked into this phone. If you swipe all the way to the left it pulls up Google Discovery. And you can't turn it off. I hate Google and want nothing to do with their stuff. This phone really forces everything Google on you.

Do I like the phone? Yes. Do I love it? No. I hope OnePlus goes back to building their own apps and not just cramming Googles into it. If in wanted Google I'd buy Google Pixel.

The slogan of the OnePlus company is ""never settle."" Well, not only did they settle, they seem to have given up. And I can't settle on this phone.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3LPYA5TMCM1PI,zenraged,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/ecd84d23-8fcf-409c-808e-c3bb9ff7ddc4._CR0,0,400,400_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on July 3, 2024",True,74 people found this helpful,B0CQ5M1NXQ

275,573,US,R38CVFU9RRU07R,Best camera and battery life 💕,"I have been using this phone for a month now. I LOVE it. I have always own a galaxy and decided i wanted to try something different. The phone i had was a galaxy note 20, it got broken during hurricane beryl.
Anyways the most important thing to me in a phone are camera quality and battery life and my oneplus 12 top tier 100% .
I was shocked when i scroll on tiktok for 20- 25mins maybe longer and the battery remains at 100%..mind blowing to me. I have gone 2 days without charging this phone, While using netflix and tiktok often.
Camera is amazing and i love the additional features for editing pictures... I have no issue with this phone so far. However i cannot use the camera in tiktok to make video, tiktok downgrade the camera terribly, but outside of tiktok GREAT, CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL. 💕💕
Omg i almost forgot.. My phone charges in 30mins tops, n that's when battery life is at the lowest of 2%. 🤯🤯
There is so much i want to say, the zoom quality, the phone features, etc.. Its just too much 😊😊😊.
I LOVE MY PHONE. 💓",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R38CVFU9RRU07R,Carona Allen,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/6079ced5-64c0-4a62-9928-7827231578bb._CR0,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on August 22, 2024",True,10 people found this helpful,B0CQ5M1NXQ
275,573,US,R2VS5NS1RFASK0,Breathtaking,"I was debating if I made the right decision upgrading to this instead of waiting for the 13. From the moment I first saw it in my hand, I audibly said ""Wow."" To myself. The phone is absolutely gorgeous and feels super premium. I love all the new features, and for 700 and some change I believe I made a very worth while purchase. Camera is phenomenal. Phone speaker Audio is impressive. User experience is wonderful. I love it already. I came from a OnePlus 7 Pro, so this was one hell of an upgrade. 16GB RAM and 500GB storage in a smartphone priced at 700 bucks is actually insane. The 120hz display is vibrant, responsive, and crisp. And YES, THIS PHONE WORKS WITH VERIZON. Went to multiple stores to get a sim thinking I needed a new one to get 5G, and they kept saying they couldn't do it because the OP12 wasn't in their system, even though OnePlus says it's compatible. Put my old sim inside out of my OP7 (4G LTE chip) and it works flawlessly. And even 5G works. Don't listen to them.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2VS5NS1RFASK0,Samson,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0CQ5JGH2Y
275,573,US,R3098C7F4D2LJX,Underrated brand that never settles,"Bought my One Plus 12 almost a month now coming from a One Plus 7t Pro, which I absolutely loved and is still the best phone I ever owned in my life for just the popup front camera alone. Had it for 4 years and battery rating was at 84% before I decided it was time for a upgrade and sold it to buy this one.

I do miss the popup camera but I guess I have to get used to the front camera punches in phones now as it seems to be the norm with majority of smartphones these days. The One Plus 12, man is it an awesome phone for the price I got it for. Bought it on Prime Day with the deal bringing it down to just $699 before taxes for the 16gb of RAM and 512 storage version. I put a lot of videos and music on my phone and other media which I don't want to delete or use cloud storage for so the version was an absolute must for me. This phone coming from my previous with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor is so much faster and I noticed the difference instantly when loading up Real Racing 3 which loads up almost instantly compared to my previous One Plus which was also no slough. The 16 gigs of RAM is so useful for the multiple applications I tend to switch between and most times they stay open rather than reload. Thew best thing about this phone to me so far is the battery life, man does it last much longer than the 7t pro for gaming and when it does get low the almost 100 watt charging takes less than 20 minutes for me to be able to game again for another few hours and the wireless charging and reverse wireless charging are also nice to have in case of convenience or emergencies. I don't really take much photos but the few I have taken is so clear and looks really good on this phone and the phone looks so sexy that people think that it's four cameras on this phone but it really is just three.

I really can't find any cons about this phone other than the normal price at $899 and no AI features, but considering the hardware your getting and the 120 hertz screen fluidness, I would say worth every dollar.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3098C7F4D2LJX,Powpow,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 30, 2024",True,One person found this helpful,B0CQ5JGH2Y
275,573,US,RSJP7SGVQ6IIC,This made me switch from an iPhone!,"I've used Apple products since the iPhone 5 up to the 14 and wanted to break away and try something different for once with good specs since I'm tech savy. So now I've had this OP12 for a month now and I might not go back to Apple.

80-watt fast charging (US), 120hz refresh rate, 4 cameras, a 3-way ringer slider, and an IR blaster are things you'd have to beg the big apple for and pay top dollar for. This phone costs less than Apples pro models and this phone HAS all those things!

Yes, I know people complain about the cameras, and they fall a little short compared to Apple, yes, but the photos aren't bad, and I've seen photos from other phones much worse. If you wanna get more out of the camera's, Master mode on auto and ProXDR works just fine.

Overall, you get what you pay for and more with the OP12.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RSJP7SGVQ6IIC,Tanner Craig,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 9, 2024",True,,B0CQ5JGH2Y
