266,758,US,R2ENDURVUEV80,The Honda Civic of cell phones.  It'll get you where you're going,"For my uses this phone is a great deal.  I use it as a phone, for email, to text, to access the internet, for Zoom, to navigate, to take photos, and a bunch of lesser things like controlling my alarm system and thermometer, reading the Washington Post etc.  What I don’t do is game and social media.
The most important things I want in a phone are that it does what I need, which it does, and that it be stable and robust – it’s a Samsung -- nuf said.
I had been using a Samsung Galaxy J7 for the past five years but finally decided that it just didn’t have enough memory so I got the A15 which has about 4x more memory and seems perfectly adequate.  Aside from inadequate memory, my old J7 worked perfectly and still does.
I see some complaints about the A15 being slow.  It seems fine for my uses, but you’ve probably guessed by now that I’m not exactly a tech expert, power user type.  I can tell you that videos and Zoom operate smoothly.  It may not work very well for high demand functions like gaming, but I wouldn’t know.
I opted for the US version for $200 rather than the international version for $20 or $30 less because I didn’t want to mess around with any possible compatibility issues with my cell service provider.  Speaking of cost: for my uses, why would I spend 4 to 6 times more for a high-end phone -- really?
The battery seems fine.  I let it charge at night but it so far has never gone below 80% during an average day’s use.  The screen is large and sharp and the cameras seem to do a fine job.  I could only wish that it was smaller and lighter and that it had cordless charging but for the price I’m not complaining.

FYI:  The phone weighs 7.57 oz (0.47lbs) and the dimensions are 6 ¼”  x  3”",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R2ENDURVUEV80,Steven R.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024",True,40 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,RY854E7CEFD1N,Great phone under $200,"Great phone for under $200, I use this for school at home, and in public, honestly, it's got great performance, and new features being added. This is a great budget for those who want a phone that is working very well, has great performance for your needs, great battery life, and new updates to enhance the security and privacy of your phone.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RY854E7CEFD1N,Mike Mai,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 22, 2024",True,13 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,RYZH9A359XTL8,Beautiful Screen/Right size,"I bought this for my son and so fat in two weeks he loves it. Battery life is longer than advertised. He charges it every 3 days or so. Loves watching crisp videos and playing video games. Fingerprint sensor works every-time so far. Sound is louder than my iphone 14 pro. Love the option for a wired headphone, there is also the option for bluetooth accessories. Lots of phone cases available for this model. Reason for three starts? Well there is some lag speed with having multiple apps open.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RYZH9A359XTL8,J.E.R,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on May 27, 2024",True,10 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,R17NILNX9S7W2U,Waste of Money,I had an LG Stylo 5 but it was old and I found out they were going to face them out. So I decided to buy a Samsung Galaxy A15. I had several Samsung's in the past and had always loved them. So I decided that's what I was going to get.  WRONG CHOICE!!! . This is the worst phone that I have ever had!!! Didn't have it two months until the screen cracked. Things such as alarms turn will  off and on as they please. And when I do have them set they don't go off. Apps come and go as they please. Things appear on your screen that you cannot get off! You can put it on do not disturb and set it to do not turn off until I say so. Well it turns off when IT says so!! I will have things on my phone and try to go back to it Well guess what it's been wiped out.  I will be right in the middle of something and it will knock me out and then not let me back in. This happens all the time. I can't believe all this is happening with the Samsung. I mean this phone is horrible horrible!!!!! Buyer Beware!! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT HALF A STAR IF I COULD HAVE. NEVER AGAIN WHILE I BUY A SAMSUNG.,1,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R17NILNX9S7W2U,Izzybelle,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024",True,21 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,R26GKKU0E515HI,Excellent budget phone,"Excellent value phone for money. I have used A14 Samsung phone prior and I didn't think it was that slow or bad, only the screen was not very good but this phone definitely a great budget phone. This A15 phone has oled screen so the screen is excellent like the more expensive Samsung phones , battery life is excellent, calls and texts works great on Tmobile. The only thing is the processing speed is somewhat slower but not that bad for everyday functions, some internet browsing, using apps... no regret.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R26GKKU0E515HI,Lavienrose30,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on May 10, 2024",True,24 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,R3COKDPQ53BTPB,If this is what your budget allows... it works,"Yes it works, but I have complaints! The touch-screen is the biggest problem, it is unresponsive and inexact. VERY INEXACT. The battery life is pretty good, but not as good as my Moto-G. And it gets really bad call reception in my area if it's not set to wi-fi calling. I do live in a very remote location, but still, what the heck? My old phone worked! My husband's phone works! It's a phone, shouldn't its primary function be making and receiving calls? (Oh, I just betrayed my age, didn't I?)
That's all my complaints. Those caveats aside, it has good smartphone functionality and it's sturdy. It is also extremely affordable.
I'm afraid I had high expectations. Because they are the premier Android brand, I expected a low-level Samsung to be at least as good as a mid-level Motorola. NO. That is NOT the case. I will be going back to a Moto-G when this phone reaches the end of its usefulness. And I will try to take better care of the next one!",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3COKDPQ53BTPB,randall s morris,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 21, 2024",True,14 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,R3V8NZHF81VLKG,Great phone!,"This is a very nice phone. Samsung did a really good job on this one.

The build quality is solid. The plastic case is a matte iridescent deep blackish blue and does a good job at not showing fingerprints. The AMOLED screen has good colors and perfect deep blacks. The high capacity battery (5,000mAh) lasts 7-10 days with light usage before needing to recharge. The software is typical Samsung high-quality and the Samsung-built email app is still the best amongst Android phones. The fingerprint reader on the side unlocks the phone instantaneously. The charging port is USB-C. Speed-wise, the phone is plenty fast and doesn't lag. It has 5G cell phone connectivity but you can turn it off and use 4G to save on battery life. Networking also supports 2G (i.e. GSM) that can be turned on or off. Built-in storage is a whopping 128GB. Expansion-wise, the SIM tray accepts 2 SIM cards (i.e. this is indeed a dual-SIM phone), or 1 SIM card + 1 Micro-SD card. There is a headphone jack at the bottom, next to the charging port. The phone is quite big, i.e. the screen is huge, and it's rather heavy but so are most phones nowadays. It barely fits in my pants pockets.

This is marketed as an entry-level phone, but honestly, it has such much memory, long battery life, fingerprint unlock, 3 good cameras, dual-SIM, Micro-SD expansion, headphone jack, USB C, great software support, future-proof updates, and is quite fast, so you may wonder why you'd ever need to buy anything more expensive.

Overall, great modern phone at a reasonable price ($200) that should work well for most people and last a long time.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3V8NZHF81VLKG,Amazoner,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on April 26, 2024",True,107 people found this helpful,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,R15FQJNRSPA30G,First Samsung phone,"I've always purchased budget phones and my TCL 30 SE phone battery swelled up and cracked the back of the case off. So decided to give the Samsung Galaxy A15 phone a try. I like the build quality of the phone it feels solid and with 5g data and amoled display it's worth the price. It has everything I want in a phone. I don't open a lot of web page tabs so it fast enough for me. It's the four years of Android upgrades that sold me on this phone. My last phone didn't last two years before the battery problem. I hope this phone last long enough to receive all the Android upgrade. The power button is a little hard to press, but the fingerprint sensor works great. I really like this phone and highly recommend this budget phone.
Note::
Taking a screenshot is difficult because you have to press the power button and the volume down button at same time. The power is so sunken down in the frame you have to use both hands which sucks. Put the feature in the drop down menu bar like other phones.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R15FQJNRSPA30G,Michael,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 7, 2024",True,6 people found this helpful,B0CNQCZHFS
266,758,US,R3S77SYUSEGTB1,Pleasantly surpised!,"I purchased this phone as a backup in case one of our phones breaks. After the initial setup, it was soooo slow I almost boxed it back up to return. But I remembered encountering this issue on other phones, caused by restoring data and apps from previous phone.

I decided to fully update the phones software,  factory reset it, and then declined to skip the prompt to transfer data from other device. Immediate difference. NIGHT AND DAY. make sure you try this if it's slow out of the box. I honestly think I might switch over to budget phones long term, this is great for the price,  and handles everything just fine. Full days usage and I'm ending the day with 58% battery.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3S77SYUSEGTB1,Natalie,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2024",True,,B0CN1QSH8Q
266,758,US,RH7K2CP7E8JO,Samsung A-15,"I got this smartphone as an alternative to a.) Getting my iPhone 12 pro scrubbed.
b.) buying another iPhone.
To explain, I got hacked while using my iPhone and my bank wanted me to get it scrubbed in case there was some sort of malware on it. So rather than driving 40 minutes and paying $190 to get that done along with the paperwork certifying it was done, I just bought a brand new Samsung A-15 from Amazon. It performs well and satisfied my bank. Price is probably the .ain't factor in my purchasing this phone. I think I owned a Galaxy S-21 before, and I like this A-15 better. It has no water resistance, one speaker, but it has decent cameras and is fast enough loading internet sites. It's a tad big and heavy, but the + side is a larger screen. There is no inductive charging, but it uses a 25 watt charger that makes charging relatively fast. Also, the battery lasts a long time. I think it's 5000 miliamps. I've had it last over 3 days, so that's a plus. If you are an iOS user and have Apple Mail, that can be challenging, but once you set everything up, it's no big deal.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RH7K2CP7E8JO,retmico,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 20, 2024",True,15 people found this helpful,B0CNQCZHFS
