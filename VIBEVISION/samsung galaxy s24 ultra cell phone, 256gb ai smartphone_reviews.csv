1063,3126,US,R3QJ410FTP6LT4,Best photo phone ever.,I love my phone. It came brand new! It's unlocked and works with my carrier (Visible & Verizon and probably many more). The only thing I wish it had is emergency satellite commection like the iphone. I live in FL with hurricanes so that's important. I absolutely love my camera capabilities. It blows away any other phones. Everyone is amazed by the way the photos look. Unfortunately now all my friends make me take pics when we are out together. The phone has a very big screen which is nice for watching videos and playing games. It charges fast wirelessly or usb c. I read it even can charge other people's phones! Battery lasts all day when I charge it at night and use it all day long with a million apps open.,5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3QJ410FTP6LT4,Cher,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024",True,5 people found this helpful,B0CMDPJ8Y8
1063,3126,US,R34A4FBF84J53H,Super Fast Cell Phone with Great Camera,"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

The SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is an absolute powerhouse of a smartphone! From the moment I started using this device, it was clear that Samsung has truly outdone itself with this model. The 256GB of storage is more than ample for all my apps, photos, and videos, and the performance is lightning fast thanks to the latest AI technology and powerful processing.

The display is simply stunning—vivid colors, sharp details, and deep blacks make everything from streaming videos to scrolling through social media a visually immersive experience. The build quality is top-notch, and the design is sleek and premium, giving it a luxurious feel in the hand.

One of the standout features for me is the advanced camera system. The images are incredibly detailed, even in low-light conditions, and the array of shooting modes allows for creative flexibility. The battery life is impressive as well, easily lasting through a full day of heavy use without a hitch.

Being unlocked and Android-based means I have full control over my device and can switch carriers or customize settings without hassle. The software experience is smooth, with Samsung’s enhancements adding value without overwhelming the core Android experience.

Overall, the SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra is a fantastic investment for anyone looking for a high-performance, feature-packed smartphone. It’s reliable, powerful, and offers an exceptional user experience. Highly recommended!",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R34A4FBF84J53H,MZ,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on August 15, 2024",True,67 people found this helpful,B0CMDL3H3P
1063,3126,US,R1QTIYSCY7NV9N,"SAMSUNG Galaxy S24 Ultra Cell Phone, 512GB","The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra, with its impressive 512GB storage capacity, sets a high bar in the smartphone market, offering a blend of cutting-edge technology, sleek design, and robust performance. Here’s a detailed review of this flagship device:

### Design and Build
The Galaxy S24 Ultra features a premium design with a sleek glass front and back, complemented by a sturdy metal frame. Its large, edge-to-edge display is visually stunning, providing an immersive viewing experience. The phone feels solid and well-balanced in hand, though its size might be unwieldy for users with smaller hands.

### Display
Samsung has long been known for its exceptional displays, and the Galaxy S24 Ultra is no exception. The 6.8-inch Dynamic AMOLED screen offers vibrant colors, deep blacks, and excellent brightness levels, making it perfect for everything from streaming videos to gaming. The 120Hz refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and responsiveness, enhancing the overall user experience.

### Performance
Under the hood, the Galaxy S24 Ultra is powered by the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 processor (or Exynos equivalent in some regions), coupled with a generous 12GB of RAM. This combination ensures that the phone can handle intensive tasks, multitasking, and high-end gaming with ease. The 512GB of internal storage provides ample space for apps, media, and files, making it ideal for power users.

### Camera
One of the standout features of the S24 Ultra is its camera system. The quad-camera setup includes a 200MP main sensor, ultra-wide, telephoto, and periscope lenses. The camera delivers exceptional photo and video quality, with sharp details, accurate colors, and impressive low-light performance. The zoom capabilities, up to 100x, allow for capturing distant subjects with surprising clarity.

### Battery Life
The phone boasts a 5000mAh battery, which comfortably lasts a full day of heavy usage. The inclusion of fast charging, both wired and wireless, means you can quickly top up the battery when needed. Additionally, the S24 Ultra supports reverse wireless charging, allowing you to charge other devices on the go.

### Software
Running on Samsung’s One UI over Android 14, the Galaxy S24 Ultra provides a smooth and intuitive user interface. Samsung’s software suite offers plenty of customization options and useful features, although some users might find the pre-installed apps and bloatware unnecessary.

### Connectivity and Extras
The S24 Ultra supports 5G connectivity, ensuring fast data speeds and future-proofing your device. It also includes other high-end features like an under-display fingerprint scanner, facial recognition, and IP68 water and dust resistance. The lack of a headphone jack might be a downside for some, but it’s a common trend in modern smartphones.

### Price
As a flagship device, the Galaxy S24 Ultra comes with a premium price tag. The 512GB model, in particular, is an investment, but it justifies the cost with its high-end specifications and features. It’s an excellent choice for those who demand the best in performance, camera quality, and storage capacity.

### Conclusion
The Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra 512GB is a powerhouse smartphone that excels in nearly every aspect. From its stunning display and powerful performance to its versatile camera system and ample storage, it’s designed to meet the needs of demanding users. While the price is high and the size may not suit everyone, it stands out as one of the best smartphones available in 2024.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1QTIYSCY7NV9N,Benjamin,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/3a1bd0aa-0968-4c22-90e2-b301c7ca075d._CR62,0,375,375_SX48_.jpg","Reviewed in the United States on July 24, 2024",True,42 people found this helpful,B0CMDMKQB7
1063,3126,US,R8WT3QJW9GBSD,The perfect phone that doesn't come cheap,"PLEEEEEASE people, stop complaining about the display and things like that, the display is just AMAZING!!

By looking at the low rating of the item, I was really impatient to recieve my device and finally write the review about it. I pre-ordered the S24 Ultra in Violet color, 512Gb version, and want to note that everything was fair as expected - I got the 512Gb version at the price of 256Gb one, and also 200$ Amazon Gift, which is a non-redeemable gift that works as a single time -200$ to your purchases FROM AMAZON, that you can use within approximately 5 or 6 months.
Next about the device - it's really beautiful! I really love everything about it, the size, the flat screen, the back cover and cameras - design-wise this is a beauty.
It has lot's of nice and fun features to play with, it's my second day of usage and I still have AI features to test, camera capabilities to check out, etc. And the S Pen - this is my first ever Samsung phone, and I really got used to it, and to be honest - it's sometimes a lot more comfortable to use the S Pen instead of your fingers. Some things in life are really designed to be accomplished with a pen and paper, this phone covers that need!
The sound and speakers are veeery loud, I mean my whole office can hear my incoming notifications lol, and the quality of music listening, video watching, etc. - really nice.
I still have to find out all of the capabilities of the camera, this is a separate big topic, but so far I can confirm what lot's of reviewers have already talked about - the normal photo taking is great, selfies look really amazing for a front camera, the zoom is fantastic with really good details, night mode results in bright as day photos (although a bit noisy) and video shooting is also nice with different mods.
The OS is very nice and really sophisticated to say the least, I mean you can connect the device to a monitor, mouse and keyboard via some 5-in-1 Anker for example, and here you just got yourself a laptop with the size of a phone. OneUI is really the most rich software I've used so far, and before using it I was skeptical if I'd like it or not, but I'm really getting used to it, and the features like multitasking in a true desktop way on the phone - this is something else (not the Dex, just phone multi window usage, that's AWESOME).
The battery is nice, maybe I expected something more by viewing some reviews with almost 20 hours of screen time or so, but really it's fine for a day of usage with QHD resolution, adaptive brightness, and app and AI usage during the whole day.
The only disadvantages I want to mention are the price tag that is high (let's be honest) and the box contents, I mean why copy bad stuff from Apple and not include at least a small charging brick in the box? This is really uncool, especially within that price.
I started with the display, but want to finish talking about it as well, it's HUGE, and I really like it, the corners are sharp-ended, but that gives you the advantage of viewing a non-cropped-out content, the resolution, the brightness, refresh rate... The display is a killer really, I really don't get the people that complain about the color, or perform some tests on the device, etc.... no need.
Overall I'm really happy with my purchase, this is a great phone I can recommend to any software and hardware enthusiasts like me, and maybe to iPhone users as well, to come out of the box and see that there are other great phones out there in the world that can totally kill any iPhone with all the features and stuff you get.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R8WT3QJW9GBSD,Adrian,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on February 15, 2024",True,597 people found this helpful,B0CMDPJ8Y8
1063,3126,US,R40T3RCOGBKS6,"Great phone, fast processor 256gb memory at ok price","When a phone costs $1000 it better be special.  I have had Samsung galaxies or my last 2 phones, and I'm sold.  However a grand for a phone is too steep.  So, I waited for a sale and purchased unlocked for $750.

Still pricey, but it is worth it.  It has a fast processor.  The battery lasts 16 hours or more, at the end of the day I typically have 40% charge remaining.

Iwas worried about having enough storage, without an external micro disc slot, but I've added more apps than I have ever had, and I download a number of streaming shows for offline viewing and still have plenty of space left.  12 gb RAM is also nice, I usually have 6 to 7 gb free at any given time.

Overall my fastest and most favorite phone yet.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R40T3RCOGBKS6,Amazon Customer,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 12, 2024",True,5 people found this helpful,B0CMDR2X3M
1063,3126,US,R1GMN94WK6B072,Great Deal and Perfect Phone,"I had a s20FE which was a very good phone at a great price.  After 4 yrs the battery would drain often so I decided to trade it in. Amazon had an amazing deal on the s24 256g and based an positive reviews I grabbed it. Very easy to setup and transfer data using Samsung smart switch. I wanted a Samsung, a smaller phone with good battery life. I did not want to pay a premium price. Phone is perfect size and very light. Beautiful screen inside and outdoors. Very fast processor. I set charge to 80% max and get battery life all day and into next morning, and I normally still have 20% when I recharge.  I've had over a month and have had no issues. I believe all the bugs were ironed out by the time I bought it. I have zero regrets and if you can get a deal on, I highly recommend. I'm not a big camera buff so can't comment too much on it, but the picture quality looks great.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1GMN94WK6B072,paula,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 10, 2024",True,26 people found this helpful,B0CMDTFNGM
1063,3126,US,R1C1TDKBSKR6T7,Refined to a very powerful practical tool,"I had the S23 ultra but ran it over by accident. I don't see a huge difference with the S24 ultra. It has a good camera with a good zoom which is important to me. It's now a 5x analog zoom instead of a 10x like the S23 but I don't notice a huge difference when it comes to zooming probably because the CCD chip is better at 50 megapixels instead of 12. It also does more digital manipulation with the picture afterwards which sharpens and cleans things up when zooming way in. I don't remember the S23 doing as much after you take the shot. I also notice a little bit brighter image when less light but that's probably because the CCD chip is a little larger to capture more light than the S23 ultra when it uses the 5x zoom lens. The biggest difference I see is the titanium instead of aluminum shell and it's nicer, it feels classier in your hands. I know the big hoopla is AI at the moment and Samsung is marketing it front and center, but it doesn't really make a big difference in my mind because the S23 with a firmware update has most of those features anyway. It is a refined highly powerful piece of equipment and a small step up from the S23 ultra from my experience so far.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R1C1TDKBSKR6T7,adam zucker,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 6, 2024",True,7 people found this helpful,B0CMDM65JH
1063,3126,US,RDAH1SV4EAFZ5,SAMSUNG GALAXY S24 ULTRA,"I have waited awhile before i reviewed this product it is great for day-to-day use. At a minimum it takes great pictures and video. The screen is a great size for people with average to large hands. At first glance it looks like a standard ultra model its big, orbital lens separation, sturdy, bezel with a sleek design. I have been a Samsung fan since the galaxy line up started and practically owned every model out there to test and see which one is practical me the average joe. If you a minimalist this might not be the phone for you. This has the latest tech and probably will be overwhelming for you. This is due to the endless features that it has. If you are a gamer and have several hrs to kill on your favorite Mobile game this will meet your needs and then some. If you are that person that has been a Samsung note fan than this is the phone for you. If you're a movie junkie this will def suit your needs, when you're on a break from work or just hanging out. The color details are great especially in 4k. With this being said there are some quirks that i did not know existed and will pass it on to everyone. The s24 ultra has some drawbacks if you are purchasing it directly through Samsung. Your video calling will not work on with carriers - the reason for this Samsung does not have to voip it's a software according to Samsung. This is when you go to your contacts, and you have the option for video calling. This apparently cannot be put on by your carrier as they will deny trying to add it.(Samsung blamed the carrier , the carrier blamed Samsung) After several back-and-forth conversations Samsung told me to download a 3rd party app to allow me to video call. Other providers told me they could not help me. Now would you want to tell all of your contacts to download a 3rd party app and you would have to ask yourself ""would you do it for one person?"". Moving on to text messages and multimedia. You would normally be able pictures direct to people where it would show on the receiver's messages. But instead, it will send them a link that would expire in a certain time frame. They will then have to click to download the image to their phone. My question would be, how annoying that has to be every time i send someone a picture. They have to go through a ring of fire just to see the image or video. I have also asked about this with carriers they have stated, you guessed it go with a third-party app.  to the upside the phone is great. Standard android system as they have always been great but with a lot more at your disposal. Gpu is exceptionally fast (doesn't feel laggy or buggy) Camera is outstanding have taken countless photos with it. Videos are not grainy as some cameras from the galaxy line up once were. The phone is unlocked from Samsung. Bluetooth is great, connects fast and easy. Graphics are great for this model (does not overheat like the previous models when gaming) Overall if you want a phone that does the job this can do it. But do not purchase it directly from Samsung, purchase it through your carrier to avoid the hassles and dragged-out conversations i have gone through. I hope this helps you make your decision a little bit clearer on how you want to proceed on a new phone. I am giving it 3 stars from the manufacture. There was no recourse rectifying a solution. Also, for placing blame on another company and have me contact them, rather than Samsung trying to speak to the carrier direct that it also provides phones to.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RDAH1SV4EAFZ5,ideal deals,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on July 18, 2024",True,92 people found this helpful,B0CMDPJ8Y8
1063,3126,US,RKTTO7IE3RRR6,Scammy,"Have been using an iPhone 14 Pro Max for the last few months. Before that I had a Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus for 4 years, and before that was on iPhone since the iPhone 4. I don't play the android vs ios games, so if you're looking for that pointless narrative then go elsewhere. I'm writing this review to share my experience having throughly used both platforms.

Apple has masterfully crafted a user experience that works just fine for most users. These people don't care about customizing or having an ""always on display"" that's actually always on. You have to be brainwashed not to admit that the iPhones AOD isn't really always on, no matter what settings you use. What iPhones has going for it is a finely tuned phone, texting, facetime, apple pay experience - things that make owning an iPhone convenient.

What makes Android worth owning is the ability to use it how you wanted to use it instead of a corporation telling you you're ""holding it wrong."" I enjoyed the galaxy s10. It had an excellent display, almost indistinguishable from the s24. My review will focus on the user experience/software of the S24, not the hardware. Hardware has gotten so powerful that most users will never need all that processing power.

Samsung has failed to finely tune their software like Apple has. I liked s10's OneUI look - S24 is ugly in comparison. The stark blue and light grey quick menu has been replaced with an ugly ""Material You"" color pallet. You can download ""GoodLock"" and try to change the color palette, but countless things like transparency don't work with it. Bottom line is why I  would need to spend time trying to make it look decent if it's Samsung job considering the inflated price of these phones. So many things that should be included with the phone have been placed behind a paywall, forcing you to pay to get back what was part of OneUI in older versions.

Another indication that Samsung isn't tuning its software is the fact that they gave up on their ""message"" app, now forcing you to use Googles message service, which is fine, but why bother having their own app if they never really committed to it?

So many other system apps, Samsung has to confuse the user into deciding which platform to use. You will have double the apps for every single system app, again confusing the user into deciding in which service to commit to.

I like Android, but I don't like Samsung. I don't see the point in spending a super premium price for a phone that's not fully committed to either own layer like ONEUI or Android. This has been the problem with Samsung phones since they released ONEUI. Either fully commit to your own version, or commit to stock Android - stop confusing consumers about what your product is about, and stop being scammy by holding back features behind a paywall.

My recommendation for Android users is this: You don't need to pay a super premium price to get the Android experience. Today's budget phones are powerful enough to allow you to customize it according to your own liking.",3,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RKTTO7IE3RRR6,R.S.,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 14, 2024",True,,B0CMDL3H3V
1063,3126,US,R17BOWXO6FR8D8,This feels like an actual smartphone,"So I am a previous iphone user, and i've been using iphones for the past couple of years, I started with a Motorola and so I understood what the Android felt like but switching from an iPhone to a Samsung was a big change for me, but this phone when I tell y'all, it was the best decision that I've made. I haven't had any problems with it. Everything that you think that you got with an iPhone, you got more with this Samsung. And yes, I did spend a pretty penny on this phone. However I think it was totally worth it from the customizable to the AI being installed in it to having all the Samsung feelings that make it feel like an actual smartphone. I absolutely love it. Customization is the best part of this phone. I can change it, however I want to. It's the same with an iPhone but I feel like you can do so much more with this phone now. I will say that the best part about this was the gestures that I can use on this phone. Whenever I'm trying to use my previous iPhone because it still has all my information on it, I just can't do the gestures anymore and it makes me feel like, ""Oh, that's not working in my favor,"" so I say that that is one of the best qualities and the best parts of the phone. But overall, The appearance feels amazing. It is very easy to use. The battery life is questionable. Because I tried to run it from 6am-11am and it's already down to forty percent, so I don't know what the context is. Maybe it's my own battery, but it still lasts a long time if you're not using it 24/7. The condition of the phone whenever I first got it was It felt like I just bought it from the store.
