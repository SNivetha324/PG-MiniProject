64,161,US,R25HJZJDUSNMJX,So far so good,"The dual sim in the phone I received is one physical SIM slot plus an SD card slot in the SIM tray, and the ability to load one ESIM.  I haven't tried to load an ESIM yet.  The transfer from my previous Motorola phone was painless - just transferred the SIM card and followed the prompts to move and update apps, conversations, etc.  It took a while, but it all worked.  This phone has a setting to allow wifi calling and texting, if your carrier also allows it.  I haven't tried it yet, but will be handy for travel overseas if it works well.  It took a few minutes to turn itself on after I changed the setting.  It offers unlocking with face recognition as well as fingerprint, and both work well so far.  The time format on the lock screen is the only thing I don't prefer so far: very large numbers, hour on one line, minute below that, and there is no way to change the format. The phone is fast, works as it should, and comes with a clear, lightweight plastic case which offers a better grip than smooth metal and is all the protection a careful person might need.  It comes with a European-style plug-in for the wall, and a USB to USB C charging cord.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25HJZJDUSNMJX,S.

64,161,US,RVR4CZ7E2YLJX,Great bang for your buck,"Let me start by saying I'm a true motorola fan. Been a customer for years. Last year I had an iPhone 12 pro max gifted to me (not an apple fan at all). Used for a year. Broke that needed this in a pinch. Let me say great phone!
I absolutely love moto features and the moto battery and this phone holds up to the expectations well.
I personally don't like the leather back but that's 100% personal. The phone is super lightweight which I also don't love. It makes a device feel cheap to me but I know most people really enjoy this feature so I won't deduct points for that. I also really like the slim sleak design, looks and feels nice.
Works super fast and so easy to customize everything how you like. You don't have to download any separate apps it's all built in to your liking. Amazing battery life perusal from Motorola.
Phone comes with nice charger and even better a case! Just a plain clear case, not to bulky. Keeping the nice slim look of the phone which I like. And you can decorate the case yourself which I also like.
The thumb print censor is great and works really well for me.
Where the phone really falls short is the camera. Overall just not good. You have to have crazy bright light for anything close to desent and that really sucks. I've had older ( more expensive) moto models that were much better camera. Certainly no comparison to the iPhone.
I have metro for carrier and was unable to just put the Sim in so if you're with them be prepared for some mess around also.
Overall for the price 8 out of 10",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RVR4CZ7E2YLJX,Santana,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 24, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0CQ3V9435
64,161,US,ROB38174X5B4Z,Wow! What a nice phone.,"I had a BLU G90 PRO that was having minor issues. I went with this moto g54 and Wow, what a nice phone. It transferred my contacts and photos without me even knowing. Only took about 15 minutes to set up. Nothing bad to say about the G54 as of now. The camera has slow motion, time lapse and night vision..the pics are pretty crisp day and night. Stereo speakers sound decent. Bluetooth headphones and ear buds sound fantastic. Build quality and feel is great. And this phone thankfully gives you the 3.5mm aux. jack input. Fingerprint sensor on the power button works verrry fast. You also get 8 gig ram and 256k storage. Final thoughts: For what this Moto cost you'd have to nit pick it to death to give a bad review in my opinion. I am really happy i went with Motorola.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/ROB38174X5B4Z,G.

64,161,US,R25FEEI5VKBN31,Excellent phone for the price.,"Had to update to be able to use an app that required Android 12.0 or later.
This is an excellent phone at this price point. Hard to beat.
This phone comes with Android 13.0, one time upgradable to 14.0.
I like the size, and the fingerprint reader on the right-hand side of the phone.
The battery is great and lasts about +/- 2 days.
Very happy with this purchase.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R25FEEI5VKBN31,Christophe Caltagirone,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 15, 2024",True,,B0CQ3V9435
64,161,US,R14GYN180YU10N,Works for Metro by T Mobile,I was worried because I saw a few comments saying it was incompatible with some carriers. Took it to Metro for and it it did work. There’s also a card in the box that gives instructions to make it work with all carriers. He seems to be enjoying the Motorola phone. Pretty easy to set up and use.,5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R14GYN180YU10N,Monica,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 5, 2024",True,2 people found this helpful,B0CQ3V9435
64,161,US,R3PEZ305ANI3B3,Decent Mid range phone under 200,"Came sealed in box as advertised, the built in charger is slow. You need 1+ hour to fully charge. Battery life could be better for 5000mah.

The IPS display is easy on the eyes, it falls a bit short in brightness under direct sunlight.

Capacitive fingerprint is very funcional, lots of storage, clean Android experience, (interface has hiccups sometimes).

It's not perfect but it's great considering it's under 200, I don't game in my phone I just needed something that works and this exceeds my expectations. You also get dual sim, dual speakers, micro SD, headphone jack. And 5G",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3PEZ305ANI3B3,Maximiliano,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on September 11, 2024",True,3 people found this helpful,B0CQ3V9435
