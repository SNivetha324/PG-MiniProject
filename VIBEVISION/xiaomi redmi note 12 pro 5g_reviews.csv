215,650,US,RWGFBFBHSD7QJ,"good phone, no expandable storage though","So far, I've been a fan of Xiaomi for a while, and it hasnt let me down so far, Although it does suck that it doesn't come with a expandable sd card slot, unlike the regular Redmi Note 12, so you'll be stuck at 256GB if you want to expand. It didnt come with a fast car charger like it advertised, but it still came with the proper fast charger they normally come with though. And also unlike when I got my Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro, I didnt have to buy a universal charger. It takes about 20-25 minutes to completely charge on low battery, and lasts me about 14 hours without battery saver on, but if you want to watch youtube or something all day, it'll last about 7 hours before needing to charge. There is a notable difference in battery saver mode though, the animations in swiping through the UI is not as smooth with battery saver, but it isnt so bad once you get used to it, and you'll eventually forget it was so smooth without battery saver. It also comes with a clear case, like previous Xiaomi products have too",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RWGFBFBHSD7QJ,Danny Munoz,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on December 14, 2023",True,4 people found this helpful,B0BVMPT4Y3
