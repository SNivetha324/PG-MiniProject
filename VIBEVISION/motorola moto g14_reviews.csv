21,52,US,RIB6DYIMHKJS,Best Motorola phone in the last 5 years,"I've been buying one Moto phone per year since 2019, and I have to say this one is pretty good.
My first phone is Moto G7, it was discounted from $300 to $150. I took it to Europe and back, dropped it a gazillion times, the back battery is exposed in one corner, and yet it still works today.
My second and third phone where Moto G Power 2020 and 2021. They are just too heavy. I drop one face first, cracked the screen too hard that I can't safely touch it. The other one is still working today but stutters like crazy.
My forth phone is Moto G Pure. This phone is pure garbage. Once I synced up all my apps it runs slower than a PS2. Absolute trash of a phone that should have not been release.
That brings me up to this phone, the G14. I've owned it for 2 days, transferred all my apps, so far so good.

The key points that make this a good purchase,
1. It is $130 bucks. If you buy an iPhone or flagship android, you are easily spending 10 times this amount. Now with your $1000 phone, you got to add a case to protect it, maybe you add a screen protector too. Now your phone is 2 milimeters thicker, which probably makes it bigger than this phone.
2. It looks like a shanzhaied iPhone 11. Shan Zhai means mountain fortress which just sounds very cool. If people ask you what phone it is, you can say it is motorola and they will go oh, I haven't heard that names in years.
3. It's got 2 Sim slots and a SD card slot. You heard that right, you can combine 2 numbers and add gigabytes of storage into this baby.
4. If you shop online with this phone, the seller will data mine your phone and give you better prices because it thinks you are poor.
5. It is MOTOROLA. Do you remember the days when you heard that ring ""toon dee deet do doot Hallo Moto"". Well it is on this very phone so you can feel like when you were using razer back in the early 2000s.
6. It is a hundred thirt bucks man. If you dropped this phone, or lost it, just buy another one.
7. OK I'm probably repeating myself now, you can laugh at people who takes out a small mortgage for their iphone because you can buy this one out right.",5,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RIB6DYIMHKJS,Carl,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on March 25, 2024",True,27 people found this helpful,B0CV1FCLLR

21,52,US,R22DLE94KACEQ1,Good dual Sim phone that works with US/India gsm network,"Bought this phone to use with Indian SIM card as well as US Tmobile sim, both work like a charm. Though it's not 5G it works ok. Only drawback I see is the RAM (4gb) and display brightness which is pretty low compared to other vendors. Apart from that it's good for the purpose.",4,https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R22DLE94KACEQ1,SuperTechie,"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png","Reviewed in the United States on October 8, 2024",True,,B0CV1FCLLR

I wanted a Motorola that was like the one I was upgrading from which was a 2021 MotoPower.
